<h2 id="2">Introduction</h2>

<p>From two decades of working in the medical industry, I understand how pharmaceutical drugs and medical procedures can be lifesaving in emergency care. As described below, some physicians have found there are more effective ways to treat chronic diseases such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. We have tremendous power over our health through nutrition.</p>

<h2 id="3">Fasting Methods</h2>

<h3>Daily Intermittent Fasting</h3>

<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obr.13537" title="Distribution of energy intake across the day and weight loss… | Wiley">Studies</a> <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/lose-weight-by-eating-more-in-the-morning/" title="Lose Weight by Eating More in the Morning | Nutrition Facts">showed</a> improved weight loss and metabolic health from consuming a majority of calories early in the day. Eating can be limited to an 8-hour time period or less, and fasting done through the remainder of the day.</p>

<h3 id="82">Alternate-Day Zero-Calorie Fasting</h3>

<p>Another effective method is to alternate between a day of consuming no calories, and a day of normal eating.</p>

<p>Dr. Jason Fung has seen in patients that alternate-day zero-calorie fasting resulted in improved weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin, along with reduced medication dependency and reversal of type 2 diabetes. In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190601195525/https://medium.com/better-humans/does-fasting-burn-muscle-6cb1ddf44739" title="Does Fasting Burn Muscle? | Internet Archive">article</a> and 49-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aiR1mFD7Gw" title="How to Lose Weight the Scientific Way: Intermittent Fasting | YouTube">video</a>, he explains how fasting changes hormone levels to maintain energy by burning stored fat, whereas frequent calorie-restricted eating reduces basal metabolic rate and increases hunger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from James DiNicolantonio, PharmD., Jason Fung, MD. The Longevity Solution (1st ed., p. 41). Victory Belt 2019.</p>

<p>Because hunger is such a fundamental instinct, it’s virtually impossible to ignore hunger over the long term; hunger dooms many weight-loss programs to failure. Fasting, on the other hand, often paradoxically decreases food cravings and hunger. Many patients note decreased hunger when using intermittent fasting for weight loss. They often comment that they think their stomach shrank when, in reality, hunger signaling decreased.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569118/" title="A randomized pilot study comparing zero-calorie alternate-day fasting… | PubMed">study</a> published in 2016, a randomized controlled trial of 25 obese adults compared a diet of daily calorie restriction (with frequent eating) versus alternate-day zero-calorie fasting. After 32 weeks, the alternate-day fasting group had lost twice as much visceral fat (inside the abdomen), and significantly better maintained their overall fat loss and lean mass. The alternate-day fasting group also had a 23% increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (associated with improved cognitive function), whereas the daily calorie-restricted group had a 19% decrease.</p>

<p>As detailed in "The Alternate-Day Diet" (James B. Johnson, MD., Donald R. Laub Sr., MD. Penguin 2013), animal studies found that alternate-day zero-calorie fasting improved health and longevity to a greater degree than daily calorie restriction. While fasting, cellular repair increases and gene expression changes for disease prevention. Another benefit is a euphoric, energized state of mind. The authors and colleagues have seen alternate-day fasting to benefit patients with asthma, autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis), cardiac arrhythmias, infectious diseases, insulin resistance, Meniere’s disease, menopause-related hot flashes, osteoarthritis, seasonal allergies, and Tourette’s syndrome.</p>

<h3 id="74">Multiple-Day Water-Only Fasting</h3>

<p>In the books "The Science And Fine Art of Fasting" (Mockingbird 2019) and "Fasting Can Save Your Life" (NHA 2009), Dr. Herbert M. Shelton relates his 45 years of supervising over 40,000 fasts for self-healing and weight loss. Patients had improvement in cognition, digestion, energy, sensory organs, and various conditions such as arthritis, asthma, benign tumor, colitis, eczema, enlarged prostate, gallstones, hay fever, heart disease, hypertension, impotence, migraine, multiple sclerosis, nephritis, Parkinson’s disease, psoriasis, sterility, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>In 2024 <a href="https://www.healthpromoting.com/" title="TrueNorth Health Center">TrueNorth Health Center</a> is the world’s largest facility that specializes in medically supervised water-only fasting and whole plant foods for health recovery, offering on-site services and remote consultation. They have observed patients successfully overcome arthritis, asthma, autoimmune diseases, brain trauma, chemical toxicity, fibroid tumors, heart disease, hypertension, long COVID, lymphoma, obesity, skin lesion, type 2 diabetes, and many other conditions.</p>

<p>Patients are instructed to eat only fruits and vegetables (raw or cooked) during the two days prior to a water-only fast lasting typically 1–3 weeks, and afterward follow a refeed as described below. Muscle is quickly regained after a fast, while fat loss can be maintained long term with appropriate diet.</p>

<p>In the following study, 174 hypertensive patients did water-only fasting and the average reduction in blood pressure was 37/13 mm Hg — far more effective than the 12/6 mm Hg average reduction for standard oral antihypertensive drugs with side effects.</p>

<p>Excerpt from Alan Goldhamer, DC., Douglas J. Lisle, PhD., et al. <a href="https://www.healthpromoting.com/water-fasting/fasting-research" title="Fasting Research | TrueNorth Health Center">Medically Supervised Water-only Fasting in the Treatment of Hypertension</a>. J Manip Physiol Ther 2001;24(9):336–337.</p>

<p>The water-only fasting period was followed by a period of supervised refeeding initiated by the consumption of juices made from fresh raw
fruits and vegetables. Patients received 12 ounces of fresh juice every 3 hours during the juice phase (approximately 1 day of juices only for each week of water-only fasting). The juice phase was then followed by a diet of fresh raw fruits and vegetables (approximately 1 day for each week of water-only fasting). Subsequent to these transitional regimens, a diet of whole natural foods was introduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p>I typically limit eating to a 6-hour time period and fast through the remainder of the day. While fasting I consume water, noncaloric supplements, and electrolytes for exercise. For me the most noticeable benefits are improved energy, sleep quality, and body composition.</p>

<p>Every 2–3 weeks I do an extended fast for 66–90 hours (2–3 entire days + 2 partial days). Research indicates that fasting longer than 48 hours will reach the highest level of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/how_long_do_you_need_to_fast_for_autophagy/article.htm" title="How Long Do You Need to Fast for Autophagy? | MedicineNet">autophagy</a>, the process of cells recycling old and damaged parts to operate more efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="4">Food Types and Preparation</h2>

<h3>Whole Plant Foods</h3>

<p>Studies have shown that a diet of whole plant foods with minimal processing can (1) improve digestion and immune system health; (2) stabilize blood sugar and benefit weight loss; (3) lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and inflammation; (4) reduce risk of arthritis, cancer, cognitive decline, mental illness, obesity, stroke, and type 2 diabetes; and (5) prevent and reverse heart disease.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/plant-based-diets" title="Plant-Based Diets | PCRM">Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine</a> (founded by Dr. Neal D. Barnard in 1985) and <a href="https://pmri.org/" title="Preventive Medicine Research Institute">Preventive Medicine Research Institute</a> (founded by Dr. Dean Ornish in 1984) are nonprofit research and advocacy organizations for whole-food, plant-based nutrition. Their many studies, in collaboration with scientists and medical institutions, have shown that lifestyle change including a diet of whole plant foods can prevent and reverse the progression of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. They work to change the way chronic diseases are treated by physicians, where practical dietary interventions empower patients to take control of their own health.</p>

<p>In an 82-minute video and book "How Not to Die" (Flatiron 2015), <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/" title="How Not To Die | Nutrition Facts">Dr. Michael Greger</a> presents scientific evidence that a diet of whole plant foods is protective against 15 top causes of premature death, and allows people to live healthier lives. The 96-minute film "<a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/the-film/" title="Watch Free Documentary | Forks Over Knives">Forks Over Knives</a>" (2011) examines how common chronic diseases can be prevented — and in many cases reversed — by adopting a diet of whole plant foods as a powerful way to achieve good health.</p>

<p>A variety of whole plant foods can provide enough protein for health. The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) published a Daily Value of 50 g/day protein for adults consuming 2000 calories/day. They arrived at this value by doubling the average adult requirement found by research studies to be 0.4 g/day protein per kg of body weight, equivalent to 22–33 g/day protein for adults weighing 120–180 lb (54.5–81.7 kg).</p>

<p>I choose "organic" whole plant foods when available and affordable for potentially lower exposure to pesticides. To <a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/how-to-wash-vegetables-fruits/" title="How to Wash Vegetables and Fruits to Remove Pesticides | Food Revolution">remove</a> these from produce, I wash and then soak for 15 minutes in a solution of 1 US teaspoon sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) per 3 US cups water.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="72">Culinary Herbs and Spices</h2>

<p>Used to enhance the flavor of food, a culinary herb is the leafy green part of a plant and a spice is any other part. Crushed spices tend to have a stronger aroma and flavor from the essential oils. Both are rich in antioxidants and may have <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antiviral-herbs" title="15 Impressive Herbs with Antiviral Activity | Healthline">antiviral</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ptr.7019" title="Spices and herbs: Potential antiviral preventives and immunity boosters during COVID-19 | Wiley">properties</a>.</p>

<p>Laboratory analyses found <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/your-herbs-and-spices-might-contain-arsenic-cadmium-and-lead-a6246621494/" title="Your Herbs and Spices Might Contain Arsenic, Cadmium, and Lead | Consumer Reports">significant</a> <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/2020/06/04/contaminants-found-in-90-of-herbal-supplements-tested/" title="Contaminants Found in 90% of Herbal Supplements Tested | Nutrition Facts">levels</a> of toxic heavy metals in commonly sold herbs and spices.

<p>Based on nutrition <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/spices/" title="Spices | Nutrition Facts">studies</a>, Dr. Michael Greger recommends the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Top for daily use: amla (dried Indian gooseberry powder), black cumin, pippali (Indian long pepper, Piper longum), and turmeric (add a little black pepper to increase bioavailability of curcumin).</li>

    <li>Also beneficial: allspice, barberries (Middle Eastern), basil, bay leaves, cacao (cocoa powder), cardamom, chili powder, cilantro, cinnamon (choose Ceylon, not cassia), cloves, coriander, cumin, dill, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, horseradish, lemongrass, marjoram, mustard, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, rosemary, saffron, sage, and thyme.</li>

    <li>Teas (loose leaf consumed in a beverage, not heated): chamomile, green tea (Camellia sinensis), hibiscus/jamaica/roselle, lemon balm, peppermint, and rooibos/redbush/red tea.</li>
</ul>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="8">Dietary Salt</h2>

<h3>Sodium</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/12/e003733" title="Global, regional and national sodium intakes in 1990 and 2010 | BMJ">estimated</a> adult world average for sodium is 3950 mg/day. The American Heart Association and NASEM issued guidelines for healthy adults to limit consumption of sodium to 1500 mg/day. However, doing so may actually increase mortality.</p>

<p>In a 2018 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180927151923/https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/the-salt-scam-1973d73dccd" title="The Salt Scam | Internet Archive">article</a> Dr. Jason Fung notes that consuming enough sodium is vital for maintaining healthy blood pressure and volume. He describes two large studies that found people with a low sodium intake had 15–18% higher mortality, compared to those with the highest sodium intake. Other trials found that among treated hypertensive patients, those who ate a low sodium diet had increased risk of heart attack.</p>

<p>Similar <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27216139/" title="Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events… | PubMed">findings</a> came from a pooled analysis of four studies comprising 133,000 people in 49 countries. Regardless of blood pressure, those who consumed less than 3000 mg/day sodium had significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death, compared to people consuming 4000–5000 mg/day sodium. Among those who consumed over 7000 mg/day sodium, there was increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death for people with hypertension, but not for people with healthy blood pressure.</p>

<h3>Purified</h3>

<p>I prefer dietary salt (sodium chloride) that is mined from ancient underground mineral deposits and purified by the manufacturer. One such product with no additives is Morton Canning & Pickling Salt. A packed leveled 1 US teaspoon contains approximately 3000 mg sodium. I get <a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> from a better source than dietary salt.</p>

<h3>Microplastics</h3>

<p>A 2018 <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04180" title="Global Pattern of Microplastics (MPs) in Commercial Food-Grade Salts | ACS">study</a> found that 25 of 28 different commercial sea salts from around the world contained an abundance of microplastics due to polluted seawater. On average, rock salt (mined from underground) had far less. Microplastic particles are linked to adverse effects on health.</p>

<h3>Toxic Lead</h3>

<p>Despite marketing claims, unpurified gourmet specialty salts <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pink-himalayan-salt" title="Is Pink Himalayan Salt Better Than Regular Salt? | Healthline">do not</a> contain significant amounts of minerals other than sodium chloride. However, some may contain higher amounts of toxic lead than purified salt. For example, a 2020 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7603209/" title="An Analysis of the Mineral Composition of Pink Salt Available in Australia | PubMed">study</a> found that 29 of 31 different samples of Himalayan pink salt had higher lead levels than purified table salt, on average 2.5 times more. Excluded from the average as an outlier, one sample of Himalayan pink salt had 129.5 times more lead than purified table salt.</p>

<p>Lead is a toxic heavy metal which can accumulate in the body. Elevated lead levels are common and associated with significantly <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/lead-toxicity-4th-leading-killer/" title="Lead Toxicity 4th Leading Killer | Bill Sardi">increased</a> risk of disease and mortality. High-dose oral <a href="#16" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> and crushed raw garlic can assist the body in reducing lead levels.</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="27">Kitchen Items</h2>

<p>I use glass dishes, glass and stainless-steel water containers, glass containers for storing cooked food, and stainless-steel mixing bowls and utensils. I use <a href="https://ireadlabelsforyou.com/skinny-safe-cookware/" title="Safe Cookware Guide That Makes Sense | Irina Webb">cookware</a> made of carbon steel, cast iron, and <a href="https://myersdetox.com/nickel-toxicity/" title="Nickel Toxicity | Wendy Myers">nickel-free</a> (Crestware, Farberware, Homichef) 18/0 stainless steel.</p>

<p id="75">Cook’s Illustrated <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5820-the-ultimate-way-to-season-cast-iron" title="The Ultimate Way to Season Cast Iron | Cook’s Illustrated">found</a> flaxseed oil to be the most durable type of fat for seasoning cast-iron cookware. From prolonged exposure to high heat, flaxseed oil forms a smooth, hard polymer that bonds to cast iron and protects from rust.</p>

<p>When I bought cast-iron cookware, initially I used a power sander with 50-grit sandpaper to remove the factory seasoning and smooth the cooking surface. To maintain my own seasoning, I apply a thin light coat of flaxseed oil on the cookware and place it upside down in the oven to bake at 450 °F (232 °C) for one hour, with range hood fan on and windows open for ventilation. Afterward I allow the cookware to cool in the closed oven for a few hours. With appropriate care, I find this natural coating in daily use will last up to a year.</p>

<p>I avoid:</p>

<ul>
    <li>beverage containers and cookware made from aluminum, which can accumulate in the body to damage DNA and increase potential for <a href="https://www.j-alz.com/content/human-exposure-aluminum-linked-familial-alzheimer%E2%80%99s-disease" title="Human Exposure to Aluminum Linked to Familial Alzheimer’s Disease | Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease">dementia</a></li>

<h2 id="5">Legumes</h2>

<p>A staple food in many cultures, legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils, peas) are high in protein, fiber, and polyphenols with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4608274/" title="Legumes: Health Benefits and Culinary Approaches to Increase Intake | PubMed">Studies</a> indicate that legumes can (1) benefit weight control; (2) improve blood pressure, blood glucose levels, cholesterol, and triglycerides; and (3) reduce risk of <a href="https://dailyhealthpost.com/beans-cut-risk-of-cancer/" title="Eating Beans And Other Legumes Help Cut The Risk of 5 Deadly Cancers | Daily Health Post">cancer</a>, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<h3>Baked Legumes</h3>

<p>Guy Crosby, nutrition professor at Harvard and science editor of America’s Test Kitchen, describes in an <a href="https://beaninstitute.com/cooking-with-dry-beans-food-science-insights-and-strategies-from-dr-guy-crosby/" title="Cooking with Dry Beans: Food Science Insights and Strategies | Bean Institute">article</a> and book "The Science of Good Cooking" (1st ed., p. 1262. Cook’s Illustrated 2012) how a small amount of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) added to water will make legumes softer, easier to digest, and require significantly less cooking time. (A potential additional benefit is <a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/how-to-wash-vegetables-fruits/" title="How to Wash Vegetables and Fruits to Remove Pesticides | Food Revolution">removal</a> of pesticides if present.)</p>

<ol>
    <li>For each 1 US cup of dried legumes, add 1 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate and 3 US cup of water to a stainless steel stockpot or bowl. Stir until dissolved. In this step, very little sodium is absorbed into the legumes. Do one of the following (not both):
        <ul>
            <li>Quick-soak method: Heat legumes in stockpot on stove until boiling, then turn off heat and allow to soak covered with lid for one hour (42.5% reduction in gas-forming compounds).</li>
            <li>Slow-soak method: Allow legumes to soak at room temperature for 8–24 hours (28% reduction in gas-forming compounds).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Drain legumes and rinse well, then add to a cast-iron Dutch oven (e.g. Amazon Basics 7-quart) which provides consistent heat to evenly cook. Add fresh water to cover legumes. For each 1 US cup of dried legumes used in the previous step, add 0.25 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate and stir until dissolved. Add salt and spices as desired. With lid in place, bake in 350 °F (177 °C) oven until legumes are almost tender (center of legumes may still be firm). Baking time will depend on amount and type of legumes, typically 30–60 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>For convenience I prepare a large amount and store in "7-cup round glass food storage containers." I put one container in the refridgerator to eat baked legumes during the week. I put the other containers in the freezer, and remove to thaw in the refridgerator as needed.</p>

<h3>Hummus</h3>

<p>I find hummus delicious with flatbread and simple to prepare. In a large powerful blender (e.g. Vitamix), reduce raw sesame seeds into flour. Add raw garlic, peeled lemon or citric acid, water, salt, and spices. Blend until smooth. Add baked chickpeas and further blend, tamping and adding water as needed.</p>

<p>In Middle Eastern cuisine a common garnish is olive oil, parsley, and spices such as paprika and cumin. Some brands of <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/seven-ways-to-tell-the-difference-between-real-and-fake-olive-oil-article" title="Seven Ways to Tell If Your Olive Oil Is Fake | Epicurious">olive oil</a> are sold adulterated with industrially processed seed oils.</p>

<h3>Lentil Dosa</h3>

<p>A lentil <a href="https://www.kuchpakrahahai.in/mixed-lentils-dosa-mixed-dal-dosa/" title="Instant Mixed Dal Dosa (Lentil Dosa) Recipe">dosa</a> is a thin, crispy crepe popular in India. After soaking, the lentils are blended, fermented (optional), and cooked on a stove-top griddle.</p>

<p>Dried lentils soaked overnight increase around 2.7 times in volume. A 1/2 US cup of dried lentils (96 g) <a href="https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4337/2" title="lentils | nutritiondata.self.com">contains</a> an estimated 25 g protein (50% DV), 29 g fiber (104% DV), 460 mg folate (115% RDI), 7 mg iron (39–88% RDI), 117 mg magnesium (28% RDI), and 917 mg potassium (20% RDI).</p>

<h2 id="6">Multigrain Gluten-Free Flatbread</h2>

<p>Flatbread can be a convenient way to prepare a variety of grain-like foods. My favorites are amaranth, buckwheat, non-GMO corn, quinoa, and sorghum. I grind these a half pound at a time in a large powerful blender (e.g. Vitamix), mix together into multigrain flour, and store in the freezer to keep on hand for use in the following recipe.</p>

<p>In a mixing bowl add 3 US cup of water, 1 US teaspoon of citric acid crystals, and salt as desired. Stir until dissolved. Add packed leveled 5 US cup of multigrain flour, 1 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), 1 US teaspoon of guar gum powder, and spices as desired. Stir into batter, adding more flour or water if needed. Sprinkle a thin layer of flour onto griddle (e.g. Cuisinel 13.5" round cast-iron) to prevent sticking. Scoop batter onto griddle, sprinkle with flour, and flatten with hands. Bake in 350 °F (177 °C) oven for 30 minutes.</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="7">Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h2>

<h3>Flaxseed</h3>

<p>Flaxseed is high in short-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants. Consuming flaxseed may have a mild estrogenic effect, but overall the benefits appear to be significant. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/flaxseeds" title="Flax Seeds 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits | Healthline">Studies</a> indicate flaxseed can benefit weight control, improve blood pressure and cholesterol, and reduce risk of cancer, heart disease, inflammation, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>I use an electric grinder (KitchenAid blade coffee and spice grinder combo pack) to reduce raw flaxseed into flour, then mix in a bowl with a little water, dried fruit, and spices. Another option is to liquify flaxseed and produce in a large powerful blender (e.g. Vitamix).</p>

<h3>Algae Oil</h3>

<p>An option for supplementation of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (preformed <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-vegans-take-dha-to-preserve-brain-function/" title="Should Vegans Take DHA to Preserve Brain Function? | Nutrition Facts">EPA and DHA</a>) is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/algae-oil" title="What Is Algae Oil, and Why Do People Take It? | Healthline">algae oil</a>, derived from phytoplankton grown under controlled conditions in fresh water and purified. Phytoplankton are in a different biological kingdom than blue-green algae which may contain toxins.</p>

<h3>Fish Oil</h3>

<p><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-fish-oil-just-snake-oil/" title="Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil? | Nutrition Facts">Fish</a> <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/pcbs-in-childrens-fish-oil-supplements/" title="PCBs in Children’s Fish Oil Supplements | Nutrition Facts">oil</a> is often an industry waste product and highly susceptible to becoming rancid, with potential for induced oxidative damage and increased inflammation. Toxic pollutants are another concern, even after molecular distillation.</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="65">Rice</h2>

<p>Many sources of rice have been found to be high in toxic inorganic <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/arsenic-in-rice" title="Arsenic in Rice: Should You Be Concerned? | Healthline">arsenic</a>, which is classified as a group-A human carcinogen. Long-term ingestion of arsenic can lead to blocking of blood vessels, heart disease, hypertension, impaired brain function, nerve damage, type 2 diabetes, and various types of cancer.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1892142/" title="Food Safety: U.S. Rice Serves Up Arsenic | PubMed">studies</a> by scientists Andrew Meharg and John Duxbury, basmati rice (grown in India and Pakistan) and jasmine rice (grown in Thailand) were found to contain the least amount of arsenic. Consumer Reports had similar findings, with organic basmati rice (grown in California) also testing among the lowest for arsenic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cookinglight.com/syndication/how-to-reduce-arsenic-in-rice" title="Use This Cooking Hack to Reduce Arsenic Levels in Your Rice | Cooking Light">Method</a> by Andrew Meharg found to reduce arsenic content of rice by 82%:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Soak rice in water overnight. This opens the grain’s structure and allows water-soluble arsenic within to release.</li>
    <li>Drain rice in the morning and rinse with clean water.</li>
    <li>For every one part of rice, add five parts of water to a cooking pot.</li>
    <li>Cook rice until tender. Avoid cooking until dry since released arsenic will be reabsorbed.</li>
    <li>Drain excess water from rice and rinse with clean hot water.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Sodium Bicarbonate</h3>

<p>To prepare whole-grain rice or sorghum, a small amount of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) added to water will soften the whole grains and require significantly less cooking time on the stove. A potential additional benefit is <a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/how-to-wash-vegetables-fruits/" title="How to Wash Vegetables and Fruits to Remove Pesticides | Food Revolution">removal</a> of pesticides if present.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Soaking: For each 1 US cup of dried whole grains, add 1 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate and 3 US cup of water to a stainless steel stockpot. Stir until dissolved. In this step, very little sodium is absorbed into the whole grains. Allow to soak overnight, then drain and rinse well.</li>
    <li>Cooking: For each 1 US cup of dried whole grains used in the previous step, add 0.25 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate to the cooking water and stir until dissolved.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="9">Sauerkraut</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-sauerkraut" title="8 Surprising Benefits of Sauerkraut | Healthline">Studies</a> found that raw sauerkraut with probiotic bacteria can benefit bones, brain, digestion, heart, immune system, and reduce risk of cancer. Sauerkraut is a potent stimulant for production of stomach acid, which in deficiency is an underlying cause of many intestinal problems.</p>

<p>Sauerkraut is simple to make. Weigh chopped cabbage on food scale. Calculate 2% of cabbage weight (e.g. 1000 g cabbage × 0.02 = 20 g salt) and measure that amount of salt on food scale. Add cabbage and salt to large powerful blender (e.g. Vitamix). Blend to thick consistency, tamping and adding water as needed. Scoop blended mixture to fill glass canning jars. Label with current date, attach lids, and place jars on tray in dark location at 60–75 °F (16–24 °C) for 4–8 weeks, depending on temperature.</p>

<p>Properly fermented sauerkraut can keep for many months when stored at the temperature 35 °F (2 °C) of a typical refrigerator. The benefits of probiotics are lost when heated above 106 °F (41 °C).</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="81">Sprouts</h2>

<p>Sprouts are highly nutritious and simple to grow at home. Among my favorites are sprouted broccoli, buckwheat, lentils, and sunflower.</p>

<p>I find that a 12-quart stainless steel bain marie with cover (e.g. TigerChef.com Winco BAM-12 and BAMC-12) works well for sprouting 1 US pound of dried seeds, which can grow to fill the entire container.</p>

<p>Soak dried seeds overnight in water (no sodium bicarbonate), then drain and rinse well. Cover to keep out light while growing. Briefly soak and drain twice per day until sprouts are desired length.</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="50">Vegetables Simmer or Stir-Fry With Water</h2>

<p>In the past I often steamed vegetables in a stockpot with basket, but now prefer the following two methods with more options for combining various flavors.</p>

<h3>Deep Skillet</h3>

<p>Add thinly sliced vegetables, spices, and a small amount of water to a deep skillet. Cover with lid and cook at low to medium heat. Periodically move the vegetables with a spatula and add a little more water if needed to prevent burning. The water absorbs the flavors of the food and forms a savory sauce.</p>

<p>Optional: Once the vegetables are done, add leftover precooked grains, legumes, and/or diced raw vegetables and mix together. Cover with lid and allow to warm up.</p>

<p>I use a Lodge 5-quart (12" x 3.4") L10DSK3 cast iron deep skillet, <a href="#75" title="Another section">seasoned</a> to protect it from rust, along with a glass lid. Once heated, this heavy (9.3 lb) skillet stays warm for a long time and radiates a lot of heat energy from its surface, far more than stainless steel. Avoid adding a large amount of cold water when this skillet is hot, since the sudden temperature change could cause it to crack. Properly cared for, this skillet will last a lifetime.</p>

<h3>Wok</h3>

<p>Preheat empty wok for one minute at highest setting on stove. Add finely diced vegetables and briefly cook. Keep the vegetables moving with a wok spatula and periodically add minimal water to prevent sticking. Immediately afterward clean the wok, briefly reheat to evaporate moisture, and rub with minimal coconut oil to prevent rust.</p>

<p>I use a Honey-Can-Do Origins / Joyce Chen 14" flat-bottom wok made of heavy 1.8-mm 15-gauge spun carbon steel for resistance against warping. Mine has remained flat. A mallet could reshape it if needed. The wok came from the Taiwan manufacturer with a clear protective coating, which I removed from the cooking surface by repeatedly scrubbing with fine steel wool and wiping away the powder residue with isopropyl alcohol on tissue paper.</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="10">Vitamin and Mineral Supplements</h2>

<p>Supplementation when used appropriately can be highly beneficial for health and healing. For inexpensive sources of quality supplements, I look for an established reputation with good manufacturing practices and buy in quantity when discounted. Bulk powder/crystal forms can be economical and without additives.</p>

<h3>List of What I Take</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#11" title="Another section">boron</a> 4 mg/day from homemade borax solution.</li>

    <li><a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> 12 mg/day from homemade potassium iodide solution.</li>

    <li id="38">vitamin A (SwansonVitamins.com Swanson Premium vitamin A 10,000 IU 3000 mcg RAE 250 sgels) 1 every 2 days, the equivalent of 1500 mcg/day RAE. This is preformed vitamin A as retinol, not beta-carotene. Taking this with dietary fat increases absorption. Vitamin A is important for gene expression, immune function, and vision. I regularly eat carrots and sweet potatoes which are high in provitamin A (carotenoids).</li>

    <li id="66">vitamin B-100 complex (SwansonVitamins.com Swanson Premium Balance B-100 complex high potency 300 caps | Vitacost.com Complete B-100 complex 300 capsules) with food. I open a capsule and sprinkle out a small amount. Any excess amounts of water-soluble B vitamins pass through the body and are not stored. Whole plant foods contain B vitamins, except for B12 which is naturally present in animal foods.</li>

    <li>vitamin B12&nbsp; 500 mcg/day (Natrol Vitamin B12 Fast Dissolve tablets 5000 mcg 100 Count) from tablet divided into 10 doses, 1 dose/day chewed and dissolved in mouth. Absorption is increased when supplemental B12 is mixed with saliva. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/methylcobalamin-vs-cyanocobalamin" title="Methylcobalamin vs. Cyanocobalamin: What’s the Difference? | Healthline">Studies</a> indicate that cyanocobalamin is well suited for oral B12 supplementation and considered nontoxic for healthy adults. B12 in a multivitamin/mineral supplement may be less bioavailable due to interaction with other nutrients. Another option is make a B12 intranasal supplement for increased absorption, as <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/nasal.html" title="Nasal Administration of Vitamin B-12 | Doctor Yourself">described</a> by Andrew W. Saul.</li>

    <li id="47"><a href="#16" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> (ascorbic acid) up to 16.5 g/day (Earthborn Elements 1 or 2 gallon) in water drank throughout the day.</li>

This amount is equivalent to 267 mg/day 2R-alpha-tocopherol. Taking this with dietary fat increases absorption. This natural form of vitamin E derived from vegetable oil is far more effective than the synthetic form (dl-alpha tocopheryl) made from coal tar.</li>

    <li><a href="#18" title="Another section">zinc</a> 20 mg/day (PureBulk.com zinc picolinate 20% powder) on an empty stomach or with fruit.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following publications, <a href="https://www.tomlevymd.com/" title="Dr. Thomas E. Levy">Dr. Thomas E. Levy</a> discusses research for why to avoid taking supplemental calcium, copper, or iron.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v19n36.shtml" title="The Toxic Nutrient Triad | Orthomolecular.org">The Toxic Nutrient Triad</a>. Orthomolecular Medicine News Service 2023.</p>

<p>Except under the very limited scenarios described above, calcium, iron, and copper should never be supplemented. And in the case of calcium, a high daily intake of some dairy products can be very harmful as well. All three of these "toxic nutrients," while absolutely necessary at low levels for the health of all cells, rapidly become major weapons in bringing down the health of those same cells with only MINIMAL degrees of added intake.</p>

<p>Iron intake is especially problematic, as so many people are getting continually "supplemented" with iron, typically in the form of metallic iron filings, whenever they eat any of a large variety of common foods.</p>

<p>All three of these nutrients are some of the most common, yet still almost completely unrecognized, causes of death by heart disease and cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. Death by Calcium (1st ed., pp. 35–36). MedFox 2013.</p>

<p>You are 30% more likely to have a heart attack and up to 20% more likely to have a stroke if you take an extra 500 mg of calcium or more per day — that’s the consensus derived from a comprehensive review of 15 independent clinical investigations. The reviewing researchers reported that subjects taking calcium supplements (500 mg or more per day) had a 27 to 31% higher risk of heart attack and a 12 to 20% greater risk of stroke.</p>

<p>Dump more calcium into the caldron and the brew becomes even more deadly. A study of over 61,000 participants viewed over a 19-year period concludes that those with calcium intakes over 1,400 mg/day had an alarming 40% increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in general and a 114% increase in risk of death from a reduced flow of blood to the heart muscle (ischemic heart disease).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Bone Health and Vitamin K</h3>

<p>For <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n22.shtml" title="Bone Health and Osteoporosis: An Orthomolecular Perspective | Orthomolecular.org">bone health</a>, I regularly do weight-bearing exercise and consume sources of boron, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin K. Vitamin K is important for bones, cellular functions, blood coagulation, and prevention of mineralization in blood vessels. I regularly eat <a href="https://www.healthsomeness.com/foods-high-in/vitamin-k/" title="54 Foods Rich In Vitamin K | Healthsomeness">foods</a> high in vitamin K1 such as parsley, dandelion greens, kale, collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage. Consuming these with dietary fat increases absorption of vitamin K1. The body can create vitamin K2 in the gastrointestinal tract from vitamin K1. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613455/" title="The Synergistic Interplay between Vitamins D and K for Bone and Cardiovascular Health | PubMed">Studies</a> found that supplemental vitamin K may benefit those who don’t get enough in their diet.</p>

<hr />

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 id="11">Boron</h2>

<p>Boron is important for vitamin D and parathyroid glands which regulate calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus for healthy bones, joints, and teeth. Supplemental boron may benefit testosterone and estrogen levels, as well as cognition and memory. Boron deficiency can lead to arthritis and calcification of soft tissues. I found the following to be a comprehensive summary of related research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Lara Pizzorno, MDiv, MA, LMT. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712861/" title="Nothing Boring About Boron | PubMed">Nothing Boring About Boron</a>. Integrative Medicine: A Clinician’s Journal 2015;14(4):35–48.</p>

<p>Boron has been proven to be an important trace mineral because it (1) is essential for the growth and maintenance of bone; (2) greatly improves wound healing; (3) beneficially impacts the body’s use of estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin D; (4) boosts magnesium absorption; (5) reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as hs-CRP and TNF-α; (6) raises levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; (7) protects against pesticide-induced oxidative stress and heavy-metal toxicity; (8) improves brain electrical activity, cognitive performance, and short-term memory in elders; (9) influences the formation and activity of key biomolecules, such as SAM-e and NAD+; (10) has demonstrated preventive and therapeutic effects in a number of cancers, such as prostate, cervical, and lung cancers and multiple and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and (11) may help ameliorate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutic agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Borax</h3>

<p>Borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) contains boron and is a natural mineral mined from dried salt lakes. Borax has a long history of use in small amounts as a food preservative, but is no longer commonly used for that purpose due to concerns of prolonged excessive ingestion of boron.</p>

<p>20 Mule Team Borax has been manufactured since 1891 from one of the world’s largest borax deposits in California. After removal from the ground, the product is washed, dried, and packaged in its pure form with no chemical additives. The product is 99.5% pure and the remaining 0.5% contains naturally occurring trace minerals, with no risk of toxic heavy metals. Pharmaceutical-grade borax is not noticeably purer or better.</p>

<p>Borax is <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/borictech.html#cancer" title="Boric Acid and Its Sodium Borate Salts - Carcinogenicity | NPIC">classified</a> by the U.S. EPA as "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" under the 2005 carcinogen assessment guidelines. The U.S. EPA <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/borictech.html#acute" title="Boric Acid and Its Sodium Borate Salts - Acute Toxicity | NPIC">considers</a> borax to be low in acute toxicity, with an oral LD<sub>50</sub> (median lethal dose) of 4550–4980 mg/kg (per kg of body weight) based on rat testing. In comparison, the oral LD<sub>50</sub> for dietary salt (sodium chloride) is 3000 mg/kg.</p>

<p>In the 1960s <a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/Healing_the_Body/The-Borax-Conspiracy.html" title="The Borax Conspiracy | Walter Last">Dr. Rex Newnham</a> found borax to be effective for arthritis and widely sold the treatment in Australia until the pharmaceutical industry lobbied authorities to prohibit it. In publications Dr. Newnham suggests an adult oral dosage equivalent to 9 mg/day boron for 1–3 months until arthritis symptoms resolve, followed by a maintenance dosage of 3 mg/day boron. His research included a double-blind trial that showed 70% of people with arthritis greatly improved from the treatment, though initially a Herxheimer reaction may occur. Some had improvement in heart disease, energy levels, and overall health.</p>

<p>In publications Dr. Newnham notes the low (0.5–1%) rates of arthritis for people in Israel, with a high estimated dietary intake of 5–8 mg/day boron due to the soil. This is well under the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 20 mg/day boron, determined unlikely to cause any adverse effects for healthy adults in long-term use.</p>

<p>In online groups, people report successful use of borax for various conditions such as Candida and other fungal infections, lupus and other autoimmune diseases, mycotoxins, and removal of toxic heavy metals and fluoride from the body.</p>

<h3>Homemade Solution</h3>

<p>To make a solution for a dosage of 4–8 mg/day boron, I add packed leveled 1.5 US teaspoon of borax powder (average 6930 mg on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale) and 1 US cup of purified water into a cooking pot. I heat on the stove and stir until the borax is dissolved, then allow to cool. The solution is stable at room temperature. I pour it into a labeled glass bottle and store in the kitchen cabinet with other supplements. Each 0.25 US teaspoon of solution contains approximately 4 mg boron.</p>

<p>6930 mg borax powder × 0.113 (11.3% boron by weight) = 783 mg boron, ÷ 192 (number of 0.25 US teaspoon in 1 US cup water) = 4 mg boron</p>

<h2 id="12">Iodine</h2>

<p><a href="#59" title="Another section">Formulation and Dosage</a> | <a href="#60" title="Another section">Homemade Solution</a> | <a href="#61" title="Another section">My Experience</a></p>

<p>The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) published a Reference Daily Intake (previously RDA) of 150 mcg/day iodine and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 1100 mcg/day iodine for adults. However, much higher dosages are suggested by physicians and researchers experienced with the use of iodine for health and healing.</p>

<p>In journal <a href="https://www.optimox.com/education/" title="Education | Optimox">articles</a> Dr. Guy E. Abraham, Dr. Jorge D. Flechas, and Dr. David Brownstein discuss research that indicates iodine supplementation can protect against radiation, has antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects throughout the body, and assists with excretion of toxic heavy metals. Other potential benefits include improved blood pressure, blood sugar, cardiac rhythm, cognitive function, immune system, and response to thyroid hormones. Environmental toxins can reduce the body’s absorption of iodine — deficiency is common and a causative factor in breast cancer, fibrocystic breast disease, and thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Graves’ disease, and Hashimoto’s disease.</p>

<p>Food sensitivity is also a major cause of autoimmune-related thyroid conditions. Common allergens include dairy, gluten, and soy. Important for recovery is an <a href="https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/elimination-diet-for-hashimotos/" title="Uncover Your Hashimoto’s Root Cause with an Elimination Diet | Thyroid Pharmacist">elimination diet</a> to identify foods that contribute to symptoms.</p>

<p>In the book "Breast Cancer and Iodine" (Trafford 2001), Dr. David Derry explains research that showed iodine supplementation can prevent several disease processes. Taking milligrams of iodine daily will saturate the thyroid and allow iodine to perform other bodily functions. Iodine can (1) trigger the death of abnormal cells to prevent spread of cancer; (2) protect against autoimmune disease by coating allergic proteins to make them non-allergic; (3) deactivate biological and chemical poisons; and (4) eliminate harmful viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lynnefarrow.net/" title="LynneFarrow.net">Lynn Farrow</a> treated her breast cancer with iodine, became a patient-activist, and <a href="http://www.iodineresearch.com/research.html" title="IodineResearch.com">researched</a> iodine for several years. Her book "The Iodine Crisis: What You Don’t Know About Iodine Can Wreck Your Life" (Devon 2013) describes the history of iodine, causes of deficiency, protocols, and frequently asked questions. Included are examples of successful use for allergy, atrial fibrillation, Candida, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, cyst, depression, eczema, endometriosis, estrogen imbalance, fatigue, fibrocystic breast disease, fibromyalgia, gum bleeding, herpes, hypertension, low libido, low testosterone, lung condition, menstrual pain, migraine headache, nodule, palpitations, prostate disease, psoriasis, Raynaud’s disease, sinus infection, thyroid condition, type 2 diabetes, and uterine fibroids.</p>

<p>In the book "Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can’t Live Without It" (Medical Alternatives 2014), <a href="https://www.drbrownstein.com/" title="Dr. Brownstein’s Holistic Medicine">Dr. David Brownstein</a> notes that when a person begins taking a high amount of iodine, the body releases toxic halides which may cause a detoxification reaction such as fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and palpitations. Supplemental magnesium, selenium, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and zinc can reduce that potential and assist the body to more efficiently utilize iodine.</p>

<h3 id="59">Formulation and Dosage</h3>

<p>For decades Dr. Brownstein has recommended iodine supplementation to nearly every patient, with typical adult oral dosages of 12–50 mg/day iodine and for some diseases up to 150 mg/day. In his clinical experience the best formulation for therapeutic use is a combination of potassium iodide (KI) and molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), as found in Lugol’s solution first made by Dr. J.G.A. Lugol in 1829.</p>

<p><a href="https://steppingstonesliving.com/the-guide/" title="Supplementing with Iodine Guide | Dr. Stephanie Buist">Dr. Stephanie Buist</a> published a free 23-page PDF "The Guide to Supplementing with Lugol’s Iodine" (2015) with information that she has found helpful to assist members of online iodine groups.</p>

<p>The Journal of Restorative Medicine published a 2017 <a href="https://journal.restorativemedicine.org/index.php/journal/article/view/112/133" title="Iodine or Iodide? A Laboratory Evaluation of the Content of ­Powdered Iodine Supplements | Journal of Restorative Medicine">study</a> by Dr. Darrow Hand and Dr. Denis Wilson. Chromatography, ion-coupled mass spectrometry, and X-ray spectrometry were used to test three different commercial dry iodine supplements that list both iodine and iodide on the label. They conclude these contain only iodide when consumed. Iodide (I-) is the ionic state of the chemical element iodine (I). The body easily converts iodide to iodine, unless the mechanisms are impaired (e.g. deficiency in NIS or tissue-specific peroxidases).</p>

<p id="58">Before iodine was isolated in the 1800s, seaweed-based medicine was used for thousands of years. Historically, the Japanese consumed an estimated 5.3–13.8 mg/day iodine in their diet, mostly from seaweed. In her book Lynn Farrow <a href="http://www.breastcancerchoices.org/seaweed.html" title="Contamination - Seaweed is No Longer a Healthy Food | Lynne Farrow">notes</a> that seaweed may now be polluted with toxic heavy metals, oil spill dispersants, radiation, or other industrial contaminants from seawater. In a March 2011 interview, Dr. Brownstein mentions that he had a few different brands of seaweed analyzed by a laboratory. About 50% of the samples had very high levels of toxic mercury and bromide, which can interfere with the body’s ability to use iodine. Also the longer the seaweed has been stored after processing, the more iodine is lost through sublimation into a gaseous state.</p>

<h3 id="60">Homemade Solution</h3>

<p>For an inexpensive source of iodine, I purchased USP (pharmaceutical-grade) potassium iodide powder crystals from CarolinaChemical.com. The product was manufactured by SQM, an established chemical company in Chile which is the largest global producer of iodine.</p>

<p>To measure potassium iodide powder, I used several sets of "Norpro mini stainless steel measuring spoons, set of 5 (TAD, DASH, PINCH, SMIDGEN and DROP)" along with a set of high-quality US measuring spoons. The powder was packed into the spoon and leveled off. I observed the following approximate measurements on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale.</p>

23.5 vertical drops/ml × 6 ml = 141 vertical drops<br />
1682 mg iodine ÷ 141 vertical drops = 12 mg iodine/vertical drop<br />

<h3 id="61">My Experience</h3>

<p>While taking the vitamins and minerals suggested by Dr. Brownstein, I gradually increased my daily iodine intake using homemade potassium iodide solutions, with no adverse effects.</p>

<p>I have used a 24% (wt/wt) potassium iodide solution in nebulization for respiratory symptoms, mouthwash for oral health and sore throat, and topical skin treatment for insect bite and minor wound. I mixed drops of this solution with drops of pure <a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a>, and repeatedly applied this to my skin where I had a small sebaceous cyst, which gradually disappeared without need for excision.</p>

<h2 id="13">Magnesium</h2>

<p>Studies referenced in publications below indicate that supplemental magnesium can reduce risk of arthritis, asthma, <a href="http://www.mgwater.com/cancer.shtml" title="Magnesium in Oncogenesis and in Anti-cancer Treatment | Dr. Mildred S. Seelig">cancer</a>, dementia, depression, heart disease, hypertension, inflammation, osteoporosis, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality. Magnesium can <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/supplemental-magnesium-important-vitamin-d-levels/" title="Is supplemental magnesium important for vitamin D levels? | Grassroots Health">increase</a> vitamin D levels and <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n05.shtml" title="What Really Causes Kidney Stones | Orthomolecular.org">reduce</a> risk of kidney stone. Magnesium helps prevent and treat inflammatory diseases; deficiency causes inflammation. Magnesium is vital for insulin-producing cells and glycemic control; deficiency can increase insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes. Magnesium is important to prevent and treat cancer; deficiency can lead to problems with transport of oxygen, decreased energy production, and abnormal cells.</p>

<p>In an <a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/Healing_the_Body/Magnesium-Chloride.html" title="Magnesium Chloride for Health & Rejuvenation | Walter Last">article</a> Walter Last describes the role of magnesium for bones, teeth, cellular energy production and repair, enzyme reactions, brain, nervous system, heart, and muscle activity.</p>

<p>In the following article, <a href="https://drcarolyndean.com/" title="Dr. Carolyn Dean">Dr. Carolyn Dean</a> suggests magnesium chloride or magnesium citrate to avoid a laxative effect that may occur with other forms of supplemental magnesium.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Carolyn Dean, MD, ND. <a href="http://www.orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v13n22.shtml" title="Magnesium | Orthomolecular.org">MAGNESIUM</a>. Orthomolecular Medicine News Service 2017.</p>

<p>However, I contend that magnesium deficiency is constantly being misdiagnosed as many different diseases, so I am merely suggesting that people treat their magnesium deficiency. Using high doses of magnesium (600–1200 mg elemental magnesium per day) for migraines, high blood pressure, angina, diabetes, high cholesterol, muscle cramps and spasms, nerve tingling and burning, is far less invasive than immediately prescribing drugs. I’ve observed thousands of people using therapeutic doses of a non-laxative form of magnesium with tremendous success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her book further explains the benefits of magnesium for a wide variety of conditions, including the importance for brain health.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Carolyn Dean, MD, ND. The Magnesium Miracle (2nd ed., p. 343). Ballantine 2017.</p>

<p>Research indicates that ample magnesium can protect brain cells from the damaging effects of aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel. We also know that low levels of brain magnesium contribute to the deposition of heavy metals in the brain that heralds Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. It appears that the metals compete with magnesium for entry into the brain cells. If magnesium is low in the brain, heavy metals gain access much more readily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.tomlevymd.com/" title="Dr. Thomas E. Levy">Dr. Thomas E. Levy</a> also wrote a comprehensive book about magnesium.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. Magnesium: Reversing Disease (1st ed., p. 29). MedFox 2019.</p>

<p>Since magnesium does most of its work inside the body’s cells, substantial body-wide deficiencies of magnesium are common even in the face of a normal serum magnesium level. And, much more often than not, this “hidden” deficiency remains unaddressed for the lifetime of the patient. As will be demonstrated in subsequent chapters, this unaddressed state of magnesium deficiency is not only the origin of many diseases, it reliably promotes and further aggravates all known diseases.</p>

<h3>Magnesium Chloride</h3>

<p>Laboratory analyses <a href="https://drsircus.com/magnesium/magnesium-chloride-product-analysis/" title="Magnesium Chloride Product Analysis | Dr. Mark Sircus">found</a> significant levels of toxic heavy metals in magnesium chloride from the Dead Sea in the Middle East, the Great Salt Lake in Utah, and the manufactured pharmaceutical-grade form sold by chemical supply houses.</p>

<p>One of the cleanest sources of magnesium chloride is the deep underground, ancient Zechstein seabed in the Netherlands. Hot water extraction and evaporation are used to produce magnesium chloride hexahydrate crystals/flakes in a purified form, with <a href="http://www.genuinezechstein.com/genuine-zechstein-coa-a101-a901.pdf" title="Certificate of Analysis | Genuine Zechstein">no risk</a> of toxic heavy metals. I purchased the Enviromedica.com Ancient Minerals brand and use an electric grinder (KitchenAid blade coffee and spice grinder combo pack) to reduce the crystals/flakes into fine powder.</p>

<p>To measure magnesium chloride hexahydrate powder, I used a set of high-quality US measuring spoons. The powder was packed into the spoon and leveled off. I observed the following approximate measurements on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale.</p>

<h2 id="35">Niacin</h2>

<p>Niacin (immediate-release nicotinic acid) has nearly 100% absorption and is the most beneficial, safest type of vitamin B3 in high dosage. Other types of vitamin B3 without a flush sensation have a lower degree of liver safety, especially extended/sustained/time-release niacin. Inositol hexaniacinate has lower absorption and is less effective. Niacinamide (aka nicotinamide) has no cardiovascular benefit.</p>

<p>Niacin is a precursor for the NAD molecule, required for 400+ different gene functions. Studies and physician reports referenced in publications below indicate that high-dose niacin (≥ 500 mg/day) can improve allergy, arthritis, attention deficit disorder, blood circulation, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n05.shtml" title="Niacin and Cancer: How vitamin B-3 protects and even helps repair your DNA | Orthomolecular.org">cancer</a>, cataract, dementia, DNA repair, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n11.shtml" title="Erectile Dysfunction and Niacin | Orthomolecular.org">erectile dysfunction</a>, fatty liver, immune system and autoimmune diseases, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n25.shtml" title="NIACIN for COVID | Orthomolecular.org">infection</a>, inflammation, <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n22.shtml" title="Reversing Chronic Kidney Disease with Niacin and Sodium Bicarbonate | Orthomolecular.org">kidney</a> disease, mental illness, migraine headache, multiple sclerosis, muscle strength, neurological disorder, Raynaud’s phenomenon, skin condition, sleep quality, and toxin removal.</p>

<p>As described in a 2024 <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v20n03.shtml" title="Niacin Was, Is, and Always will be Essential… | Orthomolecular.org">article</a> from Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, despite the occasional flawed study published to discourage its use, inexpensive high-dose niacin therapy continues to have the best outcomes for cardiovascular disease without any serious safety concerns, proven to correct dyslipidemia in many independent randomized clinical trials since 1955. High-dose niacin can improve cardiovascular health and increase longevity by raising good cholesterol (HDL) while reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesterol-associated lipoprotein (VLDL), hardening of arteries, and risk of stroke.</p>

<p>For adults with heart disease or type 2 diabetes, higher niacin intake has been linked to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37750562/" title="Association between dietary vitamin intake and mortality in US adults with diabetes | PubMed">lower</a> all-cause <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3782631/" title="Fifteen year mortality in Coronary Drug Project patients: long-term benefit with niacin | PubMed">mortality</a>. The book "Niacin: The Real Story" (Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD., Harold D. Foster, PhD. 1st ed., p. 124. Basic Health 2012) describes related studies. For example, Dr. Edwin Boyle at NIH followed 160 coronary patients taking 3 g/day niacin for 10 years and found that mortality was greatly reduced, 90% below the expected average. His report concludes, "From the strictly medical viewpoint, I believe all patients taking niacin would survive longer and enjoy life much more."</p>

<p>In the early 1950s Dr. Abram Hoffer began research and became a world authority on the therapeutic use of niacin. He founded the <a href="https://isom.ca/jom/" title="Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine">Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine</a> in 1968 and was editor-in-chief for four decades. He <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Hoffer2009int.pdf" title="An Interview with Abram Hoffer | Doctor Yourself">used</a> niacin throughout his 55-year career as a physician to help an estimated 5000 schizophrenic patients with a 90% recovery rate.</p>

<p>He usually started them at 3 g/day niacin in divided doses and noted that tests have shown this to increase liver activity, which is not necessarily a sign of liver pathology. His article <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/hoffer_niacin.html" title="Vitamin B-3: Niacin and Its Amide | Doctor Yourself">Vitamin B-3: Niacin and Its Amide</a> (Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD. Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients. 1995;147:30–39) contains a guideline of 0.5–3 g/day niacin for healthy adults, and 1–10 g/day niacin for various conditions including psychological stress, mental illness, high cholesterol, pregnancy, lactation, and infection such as cold or flu.</p>

<p>In an October 2012 <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/InterviewNiacin01.pdf" title="A Special Interview with Andrew W. Saul | Doctor Yourself">interview</a> about vitamin B3, Andrew W. Saul discusses different forms, safety of dosage, and successful use for arthritis, cardiovascular system, mental health, and sleep quality. He and Dr. Hoffer usually took 3–4 g/day niacin with meals when healthy.</p>

<p>In a 2019 <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/niacin.html" title="How to Determine a Saturation Level of Niacin | Doctor Yourself">article</a> about dosage and the flush sensation, Andrew W. Saul suggests starting with very small amounts of niacin and gradually increasing until the first flush is noticed. He notes there are physicians who consider the RDA (renamed Reference Daily Intake) for niacin as too low for optimal health, and that also taking a separate B-complex supplement can be beneficial.</p>

<p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is much <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n14.shtml" title="The Restoration of Vitamin C Synthesis in Humans | Orthomolecular.org">more</a> than a micronutrient needed in minute quantities. Humans are among the few known species unable to internally synthesize ascorbic acid because of a mutation in the gene encoding for a required liver enzyme. Many animals make ascorbic acid in significant amounts to maintain health. For example, a 150-lb (68-kg) goat produces an estimated 13 g/day ascorbic acid when healthy and up to 100 g/day during illness. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n52.shtml" title="How high-dose ascorbate therapy works on the farm | Orthomolecular.org">Farmers</a> have found that feeding their sick animals high doses of ascorbic acid powder can greatly assist in recovery.</p>

<h3 id="39">Benefit</h3>

<p>Oxidative stress from free radicals contributes to aging and development of disease. Natural compounds with antioxidant properties can protect against this. Vitamin C is an effective water-soluble antioxidant predominant in blood, intracellular fluids, and tissues. Vitamin C is also used to recycle other antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamin E.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is an important enzyme cofactor for neurotransmitters, hormones, and collagen — one of the main structural components of blood vessels, bone, cartilage, eye lens, heart valves, ligaments, muscles, skin, and tendons.</p>

<h3 id="40">Toxin and Radiation</h3>

<p>In the book "Curing the Incurable: Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins" (4th ed., p. 168. MedFox 2011), <a href="https://www.tomlevymd.com/" title="Dr. Thomas E. Levy">Dr. Thomas E. Levy</a> remarks, "Vitamin C has demonstrated the ability to neutralize a wide variety of toxic substances, many of which are completely unrelated chemically." High-dose vitamin C has been shown to reduce effects of air pollution, alcohol and food poisoning, chemical exposure, drug toxicity and withdrawal, pesticides, radiation, toxic heavy metals, and venom.</p>

<p>Lead is a toxic heavy metal which can accumulate in the body. Elevated lead levels are common and associated with significantly <a href="https://knowledgeofhealth.com/lead-toxicity-4th-leading-killer/" title="Lead Toxicity 4th Leading Killer | Bill Sardi">increased</a> risk of disease and mortality. High-dose oral vitamin C and crushed raw garlic can assist the body in reducing lead levels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v08n06.shtml" title="Vitamin C Prevents Radiation Damage | Orthomolecular.org">Studies</a> in Japan <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Radiation_VitC.pptx.pdf" title="Effect of Vitamin C and antioxidative nutrition on radiation-induced gene expression | Doctor Yourself">found</a> that high-dose (oral and IV) vitamin C helped protect Fukushima nuclear plant workers exposed to radiation during the cleanup.</p>

<h3 id="41">Infection</h3>

<p>Vitamin C when taken in frequent high oral doses may reduce cold and flu symptoms. For example, "Orthomolecular Medicine for Everyone: Megavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physicians" (Abram Hoffer, MD, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 85. Basic Health 2008) mentions a study where 252 people took 3 g/day vitamin C when healthy and 1 g/hour for six hours at onset of symptoms, which decreased by 85% compared to the control group of 463 people.</p>

<p>Dr. Suzanne Humphries wrote a <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v14n13.shtml" title="Sodium Ascorbate Treatment of Whooping Cough | Orthomolecular.org">guide</a> about high-dose oral vitamin C for infants and children with whooping cough. She comments, "I’ve received hundreds of letters of appreciation telling me how the protocol worked for parents using it on their own."</p>

<p>Studies have shown IV vitamin C to lower mortality for hospitalized patients with life-threatening conditions such as <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24484547" title="Phase I safety trial of intravenous ascorbic acid in patients with severe sepsis | Europe PMC">sepsis</a> or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6466264/" title="Effect of ascorbic acid in the treatment of tetanus | PubMed">tetanus</a>. The treatment <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n25.shtml" title="Vitamin C Evidence for Treating Complications of COVID-19 and other Viral Infections | Orthomolecular.org">has</a> also been <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n28.shtml" title="Vitamin C and Coronavirus: Not a Vaccine; Just a Humble Cure | Orthomolecular.org">used</a> throughout the world to significantly <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n50.shtml" title="Vitamin C Cuts COVID Deaths by Two-Thirds | Orthomolecular.org">reduce</a> mortality from viral infection, such as in China where 50,000 kg of vitamin C was sent to the epicenter of an epidemic in Wuhan to assist in recovery.</p>

<p>I came across numerous reports on the use of high-dose vitamin C during remarkable healing from infection. In the book "Primal Panacea" (1st ed., p. 15. MedFox 2011), Dr. Thomas E. Levy notes, "After over 15 years of research and personal observation, I can categorically say that high-dose vitamin C is a clinical miracle when compared to all of our modern drugs. Furthermore, volumes of studies exist that say it works."</p>

<p>Dr. Levy describes how physicians recommended removing life support from a swine flu patient who had been comatose for the prior month. With assistance of family, the patient then began receiving high-dose IV vitamin C and fully recovered. The book also recounts the story of a patient who was hospitalized for several weeks with bone infection of the hand, that became so severe that physicians recommended amputation to save his life. Instead the patient then began high-dose (oral and IV) vitamin C. His hand quickly healed, with the infection and swelling gone after nine days.</p>

<p>The book "Vitamin C: The Real Story" (Steve Hickey, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 117. Basic Health 2015) relates how a man successfully used up to 250 g/day oral vitamin C when he began to develop Legionnaires’ disease as confirmed by lab testing. He had recently stayed at a hotel where three other people caught the same disease and died within a few days at different hospitals.</p>

<h3 id="42">Diabetes</h3>

<p>Two <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/news-and-media-releases/articles/humble-vitamin-c-tablet-key-to-deakin-diabetes-breakthrough" title="Humble vitamin C tablet key to Deakin diabetes breakthrough">studies</a> from Deakin University in Australia found that oral vitamin C supplementation improved insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes. They took 500 mg ascorbic acid twice daily for four months. Reported benefits include a 36% drop in blood sugar spike after meals, nearly three hours per day less hyperglycaemia, and 50% reduction in hypertension. Associate Professor Glenn Wadley notes, "Vitamin C’s antioxidant properties can help counteract the high levels of free radicals found in people with diabetes, and it’s encouraging to see this benefits a number of the disease’s common comorbidities, such as high blood pressure."</p>

<h3 id="43">Cancer</h3>

<p>Steve Hickey and other researchers have <a href="http://drpasswater.com/nutrition_library/hickey.html" title="The Science of Vitamin C and Cancer | Richard A.

J Orthomol Med 2009;24(3):1–8) mentions that Dr. Abram Hoffer used high-dose oral vitamin C with 1600+ cancer patients. At least 40% reached 10 year cure rates. In an <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/cancer_hoffer.html" title="Orthomolecular Treatment of Cancer | Doctor Yourself">article</a> and book "Orthomolecular Treatment of Chronic Disease: 65 Experts on Therapeutic and Preventive Nutrition" (Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 238. Basic Health 2014), Dr. Hoffer describes an elderly patient with pancreatic cancer that other physicians considered terminal and untreatable. The patient took 40 g/day oral vitamin C, made a full recovery within six months, and lived another 22 years.</p>

<p>Dr. Hugh Riordan founded the <a href="https://riordanclinic.org/" title="Riordan Clinic">Riordan Clinic</a>, which specializes in functional and integrative medicine.

<p>Dr. Raymond CF Yuen in Singapore has researched the clinical application of high-dose IV vitamin C (HDIVC) for cancer immunotherapy. In a 2021 <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n20.shtml" title="High Dose Vitamin C for Cancer | Orthomolecular.org">article</a> he notes, "In the ten years that I have been administering HDIVC for cancer patients, I have always found it effective in improving patients’ quality of life and survival. I have seen stage 4 cancer patients who were given a poor prognosis survive longer than their oncologists’ prediction or expectation."

<p>Dr. Joseph Breslin in New Mexico successfully <a href="https://omarchives.org/video-cathcart/#11" title="Dr Robert Cathcart MD Video Transcripts | OM Archives">treated</a> cancer patients with 120–180 g/day IV vitamin C in a continuous drip from a chemotherapy pump and catheter.</p>

<h3 id="44">Formulation</h3>

<p>Ascorbic acid is the type of vitamin C that animals internally synthesize, with two extra electrons per molecule to donate to oxidized free radicals and neutralize their harmful effects in the body. Ascorbic acid powder can be economical for high oral dosage, with no added fillers found in tablets. The powder readily dissolves in water and use of a straw can keep it off teeth. A vitamin C solution is best consumed before it eventually turns yellow-brown due to oxidation from exposure to air, heat, or light. Refridgeration will slow that process.</p>

<p>Studies found that small amounts of plant pigments (flavonoids) in vitamin C products marketed as "natural" are not significant and not more effective than pure ascorbic acid. Studies found that slow timed-release capsules are not more efficient in increasing vitamin C levels, compared to other oral forms.</p>

<p>Mineral ascorbates are another type of vitamin C. Calcium ascorbate (Ester-C) contains 10% calcium, and sodium ascorbate contains 13% sodium. Excessive amounts of these minerals may not be appropriate when taken orally in high dosage. Mineral ascorbates are less potent as an antioxidant with only one extra electron per molecule to donate.</p>

<p>Ascorbyl palmitate contains 42.5% vitamin C and is not more bioavailable than pure ascorbic acid. When ascorbyl palmitate is taken orally, the small intestine releases the ascorbic acid molecule that is bound to the ester.</p>

<p id="49">Most forms of oral vitamin C require active transport in the bowel for absorption. Liposomal vitamin C is a less common, more expensive form absorbed by a different mechanism in gut cells. A liposome has a spherical phospholipid bilayer, with an internal cavity capable of carrying liquid vitamin C such as ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate. Absorption can be up to 90% of a high oral dose, depending on how the liposome encapsulation is formulated.</p>

<p>In two 2018 <a href="https://www.tomlevymd.com/interviews/passwater1/are-liposome-encapsulated-vitamin-c-and-or-the-levy-multi-c-protocol-more-effective-than-intravenous-vitamin-c/" title="Part 1 Interview: Are Liposome-encapsulated Vitamin C… | Dr. Thomas E.

Levy">articles</a>, Dr. Thomas E. Levy indicates that oral use of liposomal vitamin C during viral infection can quickly load vitamin C into immune cells in the lymphatics of the gut. He personally notes that when taking liposomal vitamin C, "I ended up overcoming a severe cold/flu more quickly than I ever had before, even when I had access to multiple 50- to 100-gram infusions of vitamin C intravenously." After receiving similar feedback from patients and healthcare practitioners, he became a consultant to LivOn Labs. He mentions that many other brands advertising liposomes do not contain such.</p>

<h3 id="63">Powder Measurement</h3>

<p>To measure ascorbic acid powder, I used several sets of "Norpro mini stainless steel measuring spoons, set of 5 (TAD, DASH, PINCH, SMIDGEN and DROP)" along with a set of high-quality US measuring spoons. The range depended on whether the powder was lightly scooped or firmly packed down into the spoon, before being leveled off. I observed the following approximate measurements on my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale.</p>

<h3 id="45">Dosage</h3>

<p>The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) published a Reference Daily Intake (previously RDA) of 90 mg/day vitamin C for adults to prevent scurvy, a life-threatening illness that quickly results from severe deficiency. This dosage is not intended for prevention of chronic diseases. Based on case reports, they published a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 2 g/day vitamin C for which almost no adults will experience loose stools. However, much higher dosages are suggested by physicians and researchers experienced with the use of high-dose vitamin C for health and healing.</p>

<p>In the early 1940s, medical pioneer Dr. Frederick R. Klenner began reporting on successful therapeutic use of high-dose (oral, intramuscular, intravenous, and topical) vitamin C for various conditions including allergy, arthritis, burns, corneal ulcer, glaucoma, heat stroke, high cholesterol, infections, mental illness, multiple sclerosis, post-surgery, pregnancy, toxins, and type 2 diabetes. During a 1948 epidemic, all 60 of his polio patients had no residual damage from the acute viral disease known to produce permanent deformities.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/198x/smith-lh-clinical_guide_1988.htm" title="Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C | Dr. Klenner">report</a> Dr. Klenner remarks, "I have never seen a patient that Vitamin C would not benefit." He <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/klennerpaper.html" title="1971 Dr. Klenner Vitamin C Paper | Doctor Yourself">suggests</a> these oral dosages of ascorbic acid in divided doses when healthy: (1) infants begin with 50 mg/day and gradually increase to 1 g/day by age one; (2) children under age ten at least 1 g/day for each year of life; and (3) adults at least 10 g/day. He mentions personally taking 10–20 g/day vitamin C when healthy.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1969, Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III used high-dose vitamin C to help over 30,000 patients throughout his career. He found ascorbic acid to be the most effective type of oral vitamin C. In a 26-minute <a href="https://archive.org/details/dr-robert-f-cathcart-presentation-on-vitamin-c" title="Dr Robert F. Cathcart presentation on vitamin C | Internet Archive">presentation</a> on various therapeutic uses, he mentions personally taking 16 g/day ascorbic acid to eliminate his chronic allergies and greatly reduce his frequent colds.</p>

<p>Dr. Cathcart notes that at least 80% of healthy adults can tolerate 10–15 g/day ascorbic acid powder dissolved in water in 4–6 divided oral doses. In a <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/cathcart_thirdface.html" title="The Third Face of Vitamin C | Doctor Yourself">report </a> he explains, "Bowel tolerance doses are the amounts of ascorbic acid tolerated orally that almost, but not quite, cause diarrhea." In another <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/titration.html" title="How to Determine a Therapeutic Dose of Vitamin C | Doctor Yourself">report</a> he details how bowel tolerance can significantly increase depending on severity of illness, allowing oral dosages of 15 to 200+ g/day without diarrhea. To be effective in recovery, dosage needs to be near bowel tolerance and taken frequently until feeling completely well.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://omarchives.org/video-cathcart/" title="Dr Robert Cathcart MD Video Transcripts | OM Archives">interview</a> Dr. Cathcart suggests adult oral dosages for acute illness, starting with 2–6 g ascorbic acid every 15 minutes, with amount increased until diarrhea, then continued at a slightly reduced amount that does not cause diarrhea. As symptoms decrease, so can bowel tolerance with dosage reduced as needed. Reducing carbohydrate intake can also improve absorption of vitamin C during illness, along with drinking plenty of water.</p>

<p>For healthy adults, the half-life of high-dose oral vitamin C in the bloodstream is estimated to be 30–120 minutes. Use of divided doses spread throughout the day allows a much higher percentage to be absorbed.</p>

<p>In "Curing the Incurable" (4th ed., p. 331. MedFox 2011), Dr. Thomas E. Levy suggests 6–12 g/day oral vitamin C in 3–4 divided doses for healthy adults, with optimal dosages usually closer to 12 g than 6 g.</p>

<p>In "How To Live Longer and Feel Better" (1st ed., p. 8. Avon 1986), renowned scientist <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/hof/2004/lpauling.html" title="Linus Pauling | Orthomolecular.org">Linus Pauling</a> suggests 6–18 g/day oral vitamin C for healthy adults. He researched vitamin C for 25 years, and in later interviews mentions personally taking 18 g/day ascorbic acid when healthy.</p>

<p>In "Vitamin C: The Real Story" (Steve Hickey, PhD., Andrew W. Saul, PhD. 1st ed., p. 62. Basic Health 2015), the authors suggest at least 2–3 g/day oral vitamin C in divided doses for healthy adults, with optimal dosages likely much higher at 50–90% of bowel tolerance. They suggest occasional retesting since it may change with time. In a 2009 <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/Hoffer2009int.pdf" title="An Interview with Abram Hoffer | Doctor Yourself">interview</a> Andrew W. Saul mentions personally taking 18 g/day ascorbic acid, and in a 2018 <a href="https://wholefoodsmagazine.com/columns/vitamin-connection/the-science-of-vitamin-c-research-on-optimizing-blood-and-cellular-levels/" title="The Science of Vitamin C Research on Optimizing Blood and Cellular Levels | Richard A. Passwater">interview</a> Steve Hickey mentions personally taking 9 g/day ascorbic acid when healthy.</p>

<h3 id="46">Safety</h3>

<p>In this section the term vitamin C refers to ascorbic acid, the type that animals internally synthesize. Vitamin C is a nontoxic, water-soluble substance that does not accumulate in the body. Since the 1940s physicians have safely used high-dose oral vitamin C to treat patients. Potential side effects are temporary gastrointestinal disturbances which quickly subside when dosage is reduced.</p>

<p>There is no compelling, consistent data that indicate any serious adverse effects from high-dose oral vitamin C. No clinical trials have ever shown vitamin C to increase any risk factors in healthy people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v19n40.shtml" title="Schizophrenia Is Chronic Encephalitis | Orthomolecular.org">Schizophrenia Is Chronic Encephalitis</a>. Orthomolecular Medicine News Service 2023.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is the safest of all known nutrient supplements. In fact, there has never been established any dose of vitamin C above which toxicity will reliably ensue. This is consistent with the fact that vitamin C is the molecule on which the physiology of all cells runs, and the healthy function of the body relies on having large amounts of it both inside the cells as well as outside of them. Arguably, vitamin C is the safest consumable agent in existence. Rare individuals can experience minimal side effects, but this should not be confused with any degree of cell-damaging toxicity. By contrast, too much water intake is toxic and can even result in death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physicians and researchers experienced with the use of high-dose vitamin C <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v06n24.shtml" title="About Objections to Vitamin C Therapy | Orthomolecular.org">confirm</a> that it does not cause B12 deficiency, birth defect, cataract, DNA damage, infertility, kidney stone, low blood sugar, or miscarriage. The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (previously Institute of Medicine) <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/135100001101535978" title="The New U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamins C and E | Redox Report">reports</a> "the in vivo data do not clearly show a causal relationship between excess vitamin C intake" and allergic response, excess iron absorption, kidney stone formation, pro-oxidant effects, reduced vitamin B12 and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7891201/" title="Effect of vitamin C on copper and iron status in men and guinea pigs | PubMed">copper</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3694287/" title="Effect of varying ascorbic acid intakes on copper absorption and ceruloplasmin levels of young men | PubMed">levels</a>, systemic conditioning or rebound scurvy.</p>

<p>Observational studies are highly variable in quality of evidence provided, potential bias, and errors. Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables may be incorrect based on an observed association between them — correlation does not imply causation. For example, people with a medical condition may be found to more frequently take a nutritional supplement to improve their health, and that does not imply that the supplement caused the medical condition.</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n06.shtml" title="Cataracts and Vitamins: The Real Story | Orthomolecular.org">Cataracts and Vitamins: The Real Story</a> (Orthomolecular.org 2013) addresses an observational study that found an association between cataract and oral vitamin C, with the incorrect implication that the vitamin C caused the cataract. It is not scientifically plausible. The study contradicts many other studies that have shown long-term benefit (e.g. 80% reduction in cataract) or short-term no effect.</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n05.shtml" title="What Really Causes Kidney Stones (And Why Vitamin C Does Not) | Orthomolecular.org">What Really Causes Kidney Stones (And Why Vitamin C Does Not)</a> (Orthomolecular.org 2013) addresses an observational study that found an association between kidney stone and oral vitamin C, with the incorrect implication that the vitamin C caused the kidney stone. Professor Emanuel Cheraskin states, "Vitamin C in the urine tends to bind calcium and decrease its free form. This means less chance of calcium’s separating out as calcium oxalate (stones)." Important factors in development of kidney stone are dehydration and high dietary intake of oxalate sources such as spinach.</p>

<p>The article <a href="https://www.patrickholford.com/blog/kidney-stones-caused-by-vitamin-c" title="Kidney stones caused by vitamin C? | Patrick Holford">Kidney stones caused by vitamin C?</a> (PatrickHolford.com 2013) describes a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9589801/" title="The effect of ascorbic acid ingestion on the biochemical… | PubMed">study</a> at the Kidney Stone Research Laboratory at University of Cape Town. Unlike other erroneous studies, for this study they used collection containers with a preservative to keep urine from changing while being stored before testing. Ten subjects took 4 g/day oral vitamin C for five days and laboratory urinalysis found no increased risk factors. A world expert in this field of research, Professor Allen Rodgers indicated that kidney stone could not be caused by use of vitamin C.</p>

<p>A 1994 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8126804/" title="Effect of high dose vitamin C on urinary oxalate levels | PubMed">study</a> published in The Journal of Urology had similar findings. The researchers tested subjects with oral dosages of up to 10 g/day vitamin C for several days and conclude, "no genuine increase in urinary oxalate was demonstrable despite a greatly increased ascorbate intake."</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v01n07.shtml" title="Vitamin C Does Not Cause Kidney Stones | Orthomolecular.org">Vitamin C Does Not Cause Kidney Stones</a> (Orthomolecular.org 2005) mentions a study of 45,251 men that found those taking above 1.5 g/day vitamin C had reduced risk of kidney stone. A follow-up study of 85,557 women for 14 years found the risk was the same for people taking under 250 mg/day and those taking 1.5 g/day. The authors of these large studies state that restricting high-dose vitamin C for potential kidney stone is unwarranted.</p>

<p>Beginning in the 1940s, <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/mccormick.html" title="Megadose Vitamin C: Dr. William J. McCormick | Doctor Yourself">Dr. William J. McCormick</a> and Dr. Frederick R. Klenner reported that long-term use of high-dose oral vitamin C does not cause kidney stone in healthy adults, and can be protective.</p>

<p>Toward the end of his career, Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III <a href="http://doctoryourself.com/kidney.html" title="Kidney Stones (Renal Calculi) and Their Relation to Diet | Doctor Yourself">reported</a> that he had put an estimated 25,000 patients on high-dose oral vitamin C and none developed kidney stone as a result. Two patients not taking a high dosage developed kidney stone; he advised them to use a high dosage and they had no further problems.</p>

<p>The book "Ascorbate: The Science of Vitamin C" (Steve Hickey, PhD., Hilary Roberts, PhD. 1st ed., p. 95. Lulu 2004) mentions that throughout his career, Dr. Cathcart never saw high-dose oral vitamin C cause any adverse effects involving G6P6 deficiency, a rare genetic mutation in people of African or Middle Eastern descent. He treated two patients with hemochromatosis and both were able to safely use high-dose oral vitamin C with no adverse effects. Hemochromatosis is excess accumulation of iron in the body, usually caused by an inherited condition.</p>

<h3 id="51">My Experience</h3>

<p>When healthy I comfortably take up to 16.5 g/day ascorbic acid powder in water drank throughout the day. On fasting days I take less due to improved absorption and lower bowel tolerance. I regularly apply a homemade 15% vitamin C <a href="#30" title="Another section">solution</a> to my face for skin care.</p>

<p>After taking high-dose vitamin C and 3 g/day <a href="#15" title="Another section">lysine</a> for several months, my vision at close distances noticeably improved.

GrassrootsHealth.net 2020.</p>

<p>The evidence connecting vitamin D and COVID-19 disease and severity is overwhelming. Studies have been published concluding that higher vitamin D levels are associated with more positive outcomes, from a decreased risk of testing positive to COVID-19 to a decreased risk of severity and death. In our last post, we shared a short video showing that 70–80% of COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D required admission to the ICU.</p>

<p>GrassrootsHealth has been actively involved for many years in research about vitamin D. They offer helpful <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/project/top-blogs-answer-common-questions/" title="Top Blogs to Answer Common Questions | Grassroots Health">information</a> and the opportunity to participate in their research <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/project/projects/" title="Projects | Grassroots Health">projects</a> using a home blood spot test, which is mailed in for them to provide the results. According to <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/research/" title="Research | Grassroots Health">studies</a> by their panel of 48 vitamin D researchers, a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 40 ng/ml (100 nmol/L) is the lower edge of optimal, with 60–80 ng/ml (150–200 nmol/L) considered ideal for health and disease prevention.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/taking-4000-iu-vitamin-d-per-day-much/" title="Is Taking More than 4,000 IU Vitamin D Per Day Too Much? | Grassroots Health">explain</a> how the RDA (renamed Reference Daily Intake) for vitamin D was off by an order of magnitude, and taking at least 4000 IU/day (100 mcg/day) is considered safe for adults. The following article includes a graph of dosages and resulting vitamin D levels in test participants, with data adjusted for 150-lb (68-kg) body weight.</p>

<p>Whether considering the extremely low recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D as set by the National Academy of Medicine (previously the IOM) or a general suggestion of intake, such as 4,000 IU per day, it is impossible to know how much might be “right” for one person to the next. In fact, a GrassrootsHealth analysis showed that among all adult participants taking an average of 4,000 IU vitamin D per day from supplements, approximately 25% were still below the recommended 40–60 ng/ml.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25441954/" title="Dietary fat increases vitamin D-3 absorption | PubMed">Studies</a> showed that taking vitamin D with dietary fat increases absorption. Vitamin D levels may also be <a href="https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/supplemental-magnesium-important-vitamin-d-levels/" title="Is supplemental magnesium important for vitamin D levels? | Grassroots Health">improved</a> with supplemental magnesium. A vitamin D researcher since the late 1970s, Bruce Hollis personally found that he could not exceed a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 50 ng/ml while taking 10,000 IU/day vitamin D without magnesium supplementation. Then he began taking 400 mg/day magnesium and found that he could attain 60 ng/ml by taking 6000 IU/day vitamin D.</p>

<p>I read that taking over 10,000 IU/day vitamin D is generally not considered an appropriate long-term dosage for most adults. However, a physician may order a short-term dosage over 10,000 IU/day vitamin D to rapidly achieve a therapeutic concentration for a patient with vitamin D deficiency or illness. Dr. David Brownstein’s short-term <a href="https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_cc5004cfa84a46d3b1a0338d4308c42c.pdf" title="A Novel Approach to Treating COVID-19 Using Nutritional and Oxidative Therapies | Dr. David Brownstein">regimen</a> for viral infection includes an adult dosage of 5000 IU vitamin D every hour, up to 50,000 IU/day (not during pregnancy).

<h2 id="36">Vitamin E</h2>

<p>Vitamin E is an antioxidant important for cardiovascular health, cellular repair, immune system, and vision. The natural form of supplemental vitamin E (d-alpha tocopherol plus mixed tocopherols) derived from vegetable oil is far more effective than the synthetic form (dl-alpha tocopheryl) made from coal tar. Taking vitamin E with dietary fat increases absorption.</p>

<p><a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v07n11.shtml" title="Vitamin E Attacked Again | Orthomolecular.org">Studies</a> indicate that high-dose vitamin E can reduce all-cause mortality in elderly, and reduce susceptibility or severity of ALS, Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, epileptic seizures in children, fatty liver disease, heart disease, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Orthomolecular Medicine News Service. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v01n01.shtml" title="Vitamin E: Safe, Effective, and Heart-Healthy | Orthomolecular.org">Vitamin E: Safe, Effective, and Heart-Healthy</a>. 2005.</p>

<p>Pioneer vitamin E researchers and clinicians Drs. Wilfrid and Evan Shute treated some 30,000 patients over several decades and found that people in average health received maximum benefit from 800 IU of the d-alpha tocopherol form of vitamin E. Vitamin E has been proven effective in the prevention and treatment of many heart conditions. "The complete or nearly complete prevention of angina attacks is the usual and expected result of treatment with alpha tocopherol" according to Wilfrid Shute, M. D., a cardiologist. Shute prescribed up to 1,600 IU of vitamin E daily and successfully treated patients for acute coronary thrombosis, acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic nephritis, and even burns, plastic surgery and mazoplasia.</p>

<h2 id="18">Zinc</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zinc-supplements" title="What Are Zinc Supplements Good For? Benefits and More | Healthline">Studies</a> found that zinc is important for immune system, insulin function, neurotransmission, regulation of gene expression, reproduction, and vision. Supplemental zinc can <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v19n33.shtml" title="How to Prevent Sepsis Mortality: Part 2 | Orthomolecular.org">reduce</a> incidence and severity of infection.</p>

<p>Zinc deficiency affects an estimated 33% of global population. Vegetarians may require as much as 50% more of the Reference Daily Intake (previously RDA) of 11 mg/day zinc for adults. Phytates in whole grains and legumes can bind zinc reducing absorption. To avoid this, I take supplemental zinc on an empty stomach or with fruit. Some may find consuming zinc with food necessary to avoid nausea.</p>

<p>I consume copper in sufficient amounts from foods and stay below the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 40 mg/day zinc, determined unlikely to cause any adverse effects for healthy adults in long-term use. Studies indicate that taking 50–180 mg/day zinc for 1–2 weeks does not result in serious side effects, but taking those dosages long term may result in copper deficiency unless copper is also supplemented.</p>

<p>In 2009 the European Food Safety Authority published the scientific opinion of 21 panel members on the use of zinc picolinate as a supplement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from F. Aguilar, U.R. Charrondiere, et al. <a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1113" title="Chromium picolinate, zinc picolinate and zinc picolinate dihydrate… | Wiley">Chromium picolinate, zinc picolinate and zinc picolinate dihydrate added for nutritional purposes in food supplements</a>. The EFSA Journal 2009;1113:1–41.</p>

<p>The majority of studies reveal a slightly greater bioavailability of zinc from zinc picolinate than from other zinc compounds, although some studies showed similar levels of absorption, and a few investigators claim a somewhat lower absorption of zinc from zinc picolinate than from other zinc compounds.</p>

<p>Based on the available, albeit limited toxicological database, the Panel concluded that at the anticipated use and use levels of zinc picolinate and zinc picolinate dihydrate, as a source of zinc, when added for nutritional purposes in food supplements, are not of safety concern as long as the UL for zinc is not exceeded.</p>

<h2 id="28">Skin Care</h2>

<h3>How I Use These Homemade Solutions</h3>

<p>In the past from extensive sun exposure, I experienced noticeable hyperpigmentation on my face. Then I adopted the following approach and my skin looks much healthier.</p>

<p> When ready to apply MSM, niacinamide, and vitamin C solutions, I add multiple drops of each into a shot glass, mixed together with drops of pure <a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a> to increase skin penetration. I use a dropper and fingers to spread the mixed liquid on my face with head tilted back and am careful to avoid my eyes. Afterward I wash my hands, but leave the liquid on my face for absorption.</p>

<p>At a separate time I apply the salicylic acid in grapeseed oil solution, along with a small amount of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil" title="Castor Oil: 4 Benefits and Uses | Healthline">castor oil</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coconut-oil-and-skin" title="Is Coconut Oil Good for Your Skin? | Healthline">coconut oil</a>. Next I briefly splash hot water onto my face and use fingers to gently scrub the skin. Afterward I wash my hands, but leave the oil on my face for absorption.</p>

<p>The percent concentrations listed below are at room temperature, about 70 °F (21 °C). These solutions will degrade slower if stored in the refridgerator, becoming supersaturated with crystals forming at the bottom of the container.</p>

<h3 id="76">15% Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Solution</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372953/" title="Methylsulfonylmethane: Applications and Safety of a Novel Dietary Supplement | PubMed">MSM</a> is a natural sulfur-based compound that easily penetrates skin with antioxidant effects. MSM can benefit collagen and keratin synthesis, hydrate dry skin, improve wound healing, increase skin firmness and elasticity, prevent and treat scarring, reduce fine lines and pigmentation, and reduce inflammation such as acne, eczema, itching, psoriasis, redness, rosacea, and sunburn.</p>

<p>To make a 15% (wt/wt) MSM solution, I add packed leveled 2 US teaspoon (8 g) MSM crystalline <a href="#70" title="Another section">powder</a> and 3 US tablespoon (44.4 g) purified water through a funnel into a labeled Aozita 2 oz (60 ml) dropper bottle and shake well.</p>

<h3 id="29">20% Niacinamide Solution</h3>

<p>Niacinamide (vitamin B3) in <a href="https://www.dermatologytimes.com/view/anti-aging-effects-niacinamide" title="The anti-aging effects of niacinamide | Dermatology Times">topical use</a> can help fade pigmentation, prevent UV damage and skin cancer, reduce inflammation and redness, reduce skin sallowness (yellowing), reduce fine lines and wrinkles, reduce pore size and improve skin texture, regulate oil production to clear acne and reduce dryness, and strengthen the skin barrier.</p>

<p>To make a 20% (wt/wt) niacinamide solution, I add packed leveled 2.75 US teaspoon (11 g) niacinamide powder (BulkSupplements.com vitamin B3 niacinamide powder 500 grams 1.1 lb) and 3 US tablespoon (44.4 g) purified water through a funnel into a labeled Aozita 2 oz (60 ml) dropper bottle and shake well.</p>

<p>To make a 3% (wt/wt) salicylic acid in grapeseed oil solution, I heat two inches of water in a cooking pot until boiling and then turn off the heat. I add 1.5 US tablespoon (21 g) grapeseed oil to the glass jar, along with packed leveled 0.125 US teaspoon (0.625 g) salicylic acid powder (Ebay.com seller "flea-market-store" in Portugal). I place the glass jar into the cooking pot of hot water and stir until the powder is dissolved in the oil.</p>

<p>"The most popular and time-tested superficial peeling agent is glycolic acid, an AHA derived from sugar cane. It is the smallest and simplest AHA in terms of chemical structure, and is also a highly hydrophilic molecule with the greatest bioavailability of all the AHAs. When properly used, superficial exfoliation with glycolic acid at concentrations of 30 to 50% has demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy in the treatment of superficial hyperpigmentation, mild-to-moderate chrono- and photoaging, and fine rhytides. Glycolic acid is often considered the first-line choice of chemical peeling agents for treatment of melasma."</p>

<p>Chlorine dioxide in low concentration is used by industry to purify drinking water and preserve food. The <a href="https://drsircus.com/chlorine-dioxide/the-universal-antidote-chlorine-dioxide-saftey/" title="The Universal Antidote – Chlorine Dioxide Saftey | Dr. Mark Sircus">safety</a> of chlorine dioxide is clearly defined by many studies and the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) is established at 3 mg/kg/day (per kg of body weight). When <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369164/" title="Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of a Chlorine Dioxide Solution | PubMed">prepared</a> with high-purity reactants, chlorine dioxide has not been found to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. Chlorine dioxide in gaseous state can irritate the lungs if breathed in high concentration. Chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) made from sodium chlorite (NaClO<sub>2</sub>) should not be confused with a much different chemical — sodium <strong>hypo</strong>chlorite (NaClO) sold as bleach is almost 300 times more toxic.</p>

<p>Physicians and researchers have found chlorine dioxide treatment to be nontoxic in therapeutic dosage and effective for various medical conditions. It is not lucrative for the pharmaceutical industry. Advocates of the treatment have been harassed by authorities and smeared by corporate media. Information such as the following has been widely censored.</p>

<h3 id="52">Chlorine Dioxide Solution (CDS) for COVID-19</h3>

<p>In a January 2021 <a href="https://rumble.com/vcxwfv-interview-with-dr.-patricia-callisperis-about-the-universal-antidote.html" title="Dr. Patricia Callisperis interview by TheUniversalAntidote video | Rumble">interview</a>, pediatric orthopedic surgeon Dr. Patricia Callisperis in La Paz, Bolivia reports that she used CDS to treat 1778 COVID-19 patients with nearly 100% success. She helped CDS become an official COVID-19 treatment by law in Bolivia. CDS was produced for the public at seven universities, three of which further researched its use for COVID-19. Among patients taking CDS, she observed recovery from autism, cancer, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. Two years ago she worked with a biochemist to investigate CDS and all evidence indicated it is nontoxic in therapeutic dosage. She then began regularly taking CDS (Protocol C) and within three weeks, she healed from oral lesions that had frequently recurred throughout her life, despite trying many medications. For the past two years her condition has not returned.</p>

<p>In a February 2021 <a href="https://rumble.com/vdm9db-interview-with-dr.-manuel-aparicio-about-his-use-of-the-universal-antidote.html" title="Dr. Manuel Aparicio interview by TheUniversalAntidote video | Rumble">interview</a>, pediatric orthopedic surgeon Dr. Manuel Aparicio</a> in Queretaro, Mexico reports that he used CDS to treat 4000 COVID-19 patients with a 99.6% success rate. He observed successful use of CDS by 50,000 patients for prevention of COVID-19 infection, with reduced severity for the small percentage diagnosed with the illness. He personally found that while taking CDS for prevention, his high cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar levels all significantly  decreased. He noticed this also happened among patients taking CDS.</p>

<p>In a February 2021 <a href="https://rumble.com/ve6yn1-doctor-cures-many-diseases-with-the-universal-antidote.html" title="Dr. Pedro Chávez Zavala interview by TheUniversalAntidote video | Rumble">interview</a>, military surgeon Dr. Pedro Chávez Zavala</a> in Toluca, Mexico reports that he used CDS to treat 3000 COVID-19 patients with a 97% success rate. The other 3% had comorbidities. He and his colleagues found the treatment to be nontoxic. He observed CDS to be effective among patients for prevention of COVID-19 infection, and has taken it himself daily for nine months without illness. He notes there are 1300 studies about medical use of chlorine dioxide. Since 2012 he has used chlorine dioxide to successfully treat patients with allergy, arthritis, Candida, heavy metal toxicity, hypertension, infection, skin disease, thyroid disorder, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>In a March 2021 <a href="https://rumble.com/vf048d-physician-cures-hiv-patient-her-own-diabetes-and-high-blood-pressure.html" title="Dr. Viviane Brunet interview by TheUniversalAntidote video | Rumble">interview</a>, obstetric gynecologist Dr. Viviane Brunet</a> in Monterrey, Mexico reports that she used CDS to treat 1500 COVID-19 patients with a 100% success rate, no hospitalizations, and without harm during pregnancy. Local medical authorities attempted to suppress the treatment due to influence from the pharmaceutical industry. To prevent COVID-19 infection, Dr. Brunet personally has taken CDS daily for a year, during which time she recovered from type 2 diabetes and hypertension, allowing her to discontinue medication. Her friend took CDS for a year and recovered from chronic leukemia. One of her patients continued to take CDS after COVID-19 infection and six weeks later no longer tested positive for HIV.</p>

<p>Biophysicist Andreas Kalcker assisted Latin American physicians with the use of CDS to treat COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, he found that all of his published research had been removed from PubMed Central, a widely accessed U.S. government website to search for biomedical and health-related literature.</p>

<p>In a March 2021 <a href="https://rumble.com/vexj5h-scientist-cured-of-arthritis-and-then-dedicates-his-life-to-helping-others-.html" title="Andreas Kalcker interview by TheUniversalAntidote video | Rumble">interview</a>, Andreas Kalcker reports that <a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/coronavirus/clinical-study-with-chlorine-dioxide.html" title="Clinical Studies with Chlorine Dioxide | Andreas Kalcker">studies</a> found treatment with CDS to be safe and effective for COVID-19 infection. <a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/coronavirus/clinical-trials.html" title="Clinical Trials | Andreas Kalcker">Clinical trials</a> are underway in Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico. He describes how the U.S. FDA attempted to suppress the treatment by claiming it was dangerous based on a small number of anecdotes, but was unable to cite any scientific evidence when requested by physicians.</p>

<h3 id="53">Resources</h3>

<p><a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/" title="AndreasKalcker.com">Andreas Kalcker</a> is an advocate of CDS, typically made over a period of hours with chlorine dioxide generated in gaseous state to dissolve in water. He has done biomedical research on chlorine dioxide since 2007, developed technology for CDS, and worked with health professionals worldwide. His website offers clinical evidence, protocols, precautions, training, and testimonials about the treatment. The following book contains similar information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Andreas Kalcker. Forbidden Health: Incurable Was Yesterday (1st ed., pp. 19–20). Voedia 2018.</p>

<p>Chlorine dioxide doesn’t only provide oxygen; the chlorine ion is an effective oxidant in the fight against bacteria, viruses, fungus, and parasites. This unique combination is also highly soluble in water, dissolving even better than blood, which is much thicker. Its solubility enables it to deliver oxygen to places in the body not usually reached, like cartilage, amniotic liquids or mucous membranes. We have even witnessed how it seemed able, in many “spontaneous remission” cases, to penetrate the deeper parts of the body, eliminating pathogens and allowing total recovery from rheumatoid arthritis, as in my case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andreas Kalcker has found that when ingested in low concentration, chlorine dioxide is fully absorbed in the stomach within 15 minutes and lasts for two hours in the body. Chlorine dioxide is more effective in divided doses taken at least 30 minutes before/after a meal, and at least two hours before/after consuming bicarbonate or antioxidants such as vitamin C, coffee, and tea. Chlorine dioxide through its oxidation-reduction potential can eliminate acidic pathogens and cancer cells. Chlorine dioxide also provides oxygen to bodily fluids and interstitial tissues, activating mitochondria to generate more energy for recovery from disease.</p>

<p>The book describes successful use by physicians for ALS (Dr. Gustavo León), brucellosis (Dr. Mario Bruseghini), cystic fibrosis (Dr. Camino G.), gonorrhea and HIV/AIDS (Dr. Klaus Schustereder), lung cancer (Dr. Conchi G.E), malaria (Dr. Jan Beute), and vesicular stomatitis (Dr. Eva Serra). Included are patient testimonials of use in recovery from various conditions such as abscess, allergy, arthritis, asthma, autism, autoimmune disease (lupus), bronchitis, cancer, Candida, cardiovascular disease, Crohn’s disease, cyst, cystic fibrosis, dementia, fibromyalgia, gout, gum disease, heavy metal toxicity, herpes, hypertension, kidney stone, inflammation, Lyme disease, meningitis, migraine headache, neurological disorder, parasites, pneumonia, poisoning, prostatitis, skin problem (acne, bite, burn, psoriasis, rash, wart, wound), thyroid disorder, tuberculosis, type 2 diabetes, typhoid, and ulcer.</p>

<p class="padded"><a href="https://theuniversalantidote.com" title="The Universal Antidote">TheUniversalAntidote.com</a> offers free publications from a critical care nurse who extensively investigated chlorine dioxide and prefers anonymity. His videos include a documentary of his findings, interviews, and training on usage. His Training Guidebook lists where to find videos, suppliers, recipes, online groups, and books. </p>

<p>His Reference Guidebook describes numerous research studies and patents. For example, Howard Alliger’s 1978 <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/DK148703B/en?inventor=Howard+Alliger&oq=Howard+Alliger&sort=old&page=1" title="Procedure for Preparing a Medicine With Germicide Properties | Howard Alliger">patent</a> "Procedure for Preparing a Medicine With Germicide Properties" is for chlorine dioxide. More recently, Alliger’s 2018 <a href="https://www.dioxidodecloro.wiki/Alliger_Cancer%20patent%202018.pdf" title="Method and Compositions for Treating Cancerous Tumors | Howard Alliger">patent</a> information provides experimental research on mice that showed cancerous tumors disappeared within 48 hours of injection with chlorine dioxide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from The Universal Antidote Interactive Reference Guidebook (p. 20). TheUniversalAntidote.com 2021.</p>

<p>To exemplify just how safe chlorine dioxide is, the pharmaceutical company, Frontier Pharmaceuticals, has produced a variety of FDA approved safe products containing chlorine dioxide that include oral rinse and skin care products, and the founder of the company, Howard Alliger, even has a patent for using chlorine dioxide to eliminate cancer. The patent states the following: "Chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a strong oxidant, can safely be injected into a subject’s body, including a tumor, although the compound has not yet been utilized as a cancer treatment in this manner."</p>

<p>It goes on to say, "ClO2 is highly penetrating, and generally considered nontoxic — as demonstrated by its application in deep wounds, 3rd degree burns, and use in oral and topical diseases."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="padded"><a href="https://jimhumble.co/important-facts-regarding-mms" title="Important Facts Regarding MMS | Jim Humble">Jim Humble</a> is an advocate of CD/MMS (master mineral solution), another method of making chlorine dioxide. Typically drops of sodium chlorite solution are mixed with drops of mild acid solution for 30 seconds, then diluted with water and immediately consumed. After finding chlorine dioxide effective for malaria in 1996, he worked with health professionals and missionaries throughout the world to develop CD/MMS protocols for a wide variety of conditions. In his experience, CD/MMS is somewhat more potent than CDS. He has taught and helped many people, both in person and through his publications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Jim Humble, Cari Lloyd. MMS Health Recovery Guidebook (1st ed., p. 2). 2016.</p>

<p>The health recovery procedures given in this book are the result of 20 years of teaching people how to use MMS to recover their health. Scores of people worldwide have used and applied the principles outlined in my first books, or taught in seminars. As a result, over the years I have received a great deal of feedback, much of which has contributed to this book. The successes, even in the beginning, were far beyond anything I had ever heard of. However, what we have achieved along the way has helped us arrive at something so fantastic that very few can believe it at first, but those who try it soon discover it for themselves.</p>

She has researched treatments since 2004, assisted online groups, presented at conferences, ran a biomedical clinic, and worked with families in 77 countries.</p>

<p>Her book "Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism" (2nd ed., 2014) explains the use of chlorine dioxide, diet, supplements, and other therapies.

<p id="64">In an April 2022 <a href="https://www.blogtalkradio.com/lostartsradio/2022/04/18/lost-arts-radio-show-382--special-guest-kerri-rivera" title="Kerri Rivera - Lost Arts Radio Show #382 | Blog Talk Radio">interview</a>, Kerri Rivera describes an updated protocol that she has found to be effective from doing online consultations for many different conditions. On the first day adults begin with 1 drop CD/MMS mixed for 60 seconds and then add to 16 ounces water in a tightly sealed glass bottle (no metal), with 1 ounce drank every 45 minutes throughout the day for 16 doses total. On each subsequent day, the amount added to 16 ounces water is increased by 1 drop CD/MMS until the dosage is no longer well tolerated. At that point they stop increasing and have reached their optimal dosage (e.g. 50–70 drops/day) to continue for health recovery. Her testing showed the concentration can last up to 72 hours when stored tightly sealed at cool temperature in a dark location. In her experience, CD/MMS is somewhat more potent than CDS. She has never seen chlorine dioxide harm anyone.</p>

<h3 id="54">Ingredients</h3>

<p>Chlorine dioxide is simple and inexpensive to make at home.</p>

<p>I bought 500 g of sodium chlorite (80% flakes, tech grade, made in USA, certified facility) from StellarChemicalCorp.com. I found 31.45% hydrochloric acid (also known as muriatic acid) solution at a hardware store and citric acid crystals at a food retailer. Only one of these acids is needed and either is fine for making CDS. I read that hydrochloric acid is preferable for making CD/MMS — citric acid could be used but will likely cause gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>

<p>Using plastic measuring spoons and a funnel, I add the following ingredients into labeled Aozita 2 oz (60 ml) glass dropper bottles. Hot water and shaking will dissolve the solids quicker. Once completed, I store the solutions in a cool dark place such as refridgerator.</p>

<hr />

<p>24% sodium chlorite solution =<br />15 g sodium chlorite 80% flakes (packed leveled 1 US tablespoon) +<br />35 ml purified water (2 US tablespoon and 1 US teaspoon)</p>

<p>Concentration: 15 g NaClO<sub>2</sub> 80% flakes × 0.80 = 12 g pure NaClO<sub>2</sub>, ÷ (15 g NaClO<sub>2</sub> 80% flakes + 35 g water), × 100 = 24% (wt/wt)</p>

<p>Total volume: 50 g total weight ÷ 1.269 g/ml density per oxy.com = 39 ml</p>

<hr />

<p>4% hydrochloric acid solution =<br />5 ml of 31.45% hydrochloric acid solution (1 US teaspoon) +<br />35 ml purified water (2 US tablespoon and 1 US teaspoon)</p>

<p>Concentration: 31.45% HCl initial × 5 ml volume = 3.93% HCl diluted × 40 ml volume. Round 3.93% to 4%.</p>

<p>Total volume: 40 ml</p>

<p>I use protective clothing, eyewear, and gloves in a well-ventilated area to avoid chemical burn. To avoid a splatter reaction, first I add 35 ml water into the dropper bottle and next add the acid.</p>

<hr />

<p>50% citric acid solution =<br />20 g citric acid crystals (packed leveled 1 US tablespoon and 2 US teaspoon) +<br />20 ml purified water (1 US tablespoon and 1 US teaspoon)</p>

<p>Concentration: 20 g citric acid ÷ (20 g citric acid + 20 g water), × 100 = 50% (wt/wt)</p>

<p>Total volume: 40 g total weight ÷ 1.2415 g/ml density per emdmillipore.com = 32 ml</p>

<p>If a lower concentration is desired for making CD/MMS, the above 50% citric acid solution can be diluted to 34% citric acid by adding 15 ml water (1 US tablespoon), for a total volume of 47 ml.</p>

<p>Concentration: 50% citric acid initial × 32 ml volume = 34% citric acid diluted × 47 ml volume.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="55">Making CDS</h3>

<p>As Andreas Kalcker demonstrates in a <a href="https://odysee.com/@Kalcker:7/C%C3%B3mo-hacer-CDS--ENG:5" title="How to make CDS with Andreas Kalcker video | Odysee">video</a>, the following is a method to make CDS with neutral pH in a 3000 ppm (0.3%) concentration. He notes this is the maximum possible and should be diluted per <a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/cds-clo2/cds-protocols.html" title="Protocols | Andreas Kalcker">protocols</a> to low concentration before usage.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add 1.5 US cup (350 ml) of purified water into a labeled glass food jar, preferably the type with hinged glass lid that latches tightly on a rubber seal. If using a jar with threaded metal lid, cover the underneath in plastic wrap to avoid metal reacting with chlorine dioxide gas. The lid must be able to seal air tight. For size of jar, less air inside is better.</li>

<li>Add 1 US teaspoon (5 ml) of 24% sodium chlorite solution and 1 US teaspoon (5 ml) of acid solution (4% hydrochloric acid or 50% citric acid) into a small container, such as a tall shot glass or plastic cap that will float. Place the small container inside the jar. The sodium chlorite + acid solution should not come in contact with the water. Tightly seal the jar with lid and place in a dark location at room temperature for 12–24 hours.</li>

<li>Optional: Before opening, refridgerate the sealed jar for 2–3 hours to increase the CDS concentration.</li>

<li>Open the jar in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing fumes. Remove the small container and discard its contents, or save for use as a disinfectant.</li>

<li>Repeat steps 2–4 for a second time to increase the CDS concentration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Store CDS tightly sealed in a dark location. Refridgerate when possible; above 52 °F (11 °C) gaseous chlorine dioxide in solution will diffuse into air. Refridgerated CDS can lose half its potency after six months, depending on how it is stored. If spilled on cloth, rinse to avoid staining.</p>

<h3 id="56">My Experience</h3>

<p>To dilute CDS to approximately 120 ppm, I add 2 US teaspoon of CDS 3000 ppm and 1 US cup of purified water into a glass bottle, and store tightly sealed with plastic cap in the refridgerator. I regularly use diluted CDS for gargling, mouthwashing, and nasal rinsing. Hospital studies showed similar use of diluted <a href="#23" title="Another section">hydrogen peroxide</a> to be effective for prevention of viral infection. Research <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831889/" title="Effects of a mouthwash with chlorine dioxide on oral malodor… | PubMed">found</a> CDS to benefit oral health and eliminate bacteria that cause cavities. CDS has a neutral pH which does not affect tooth enamel.</p>

<p>For symptoms of a blocked tear duct and potential eye infection, I repeatedly applied drops of <a href="#21" title="Another section">ionic nanoparticle silver</a> 20 ppm, and CDS diluted to approximately 230 ppm (0.5 US teaspoon of CDS 3000 ppm + 2 US tablespoon of purified water). There was immediate pain relief and the condition quickly resolved.</p>

<p>In the following book, Dr. Morton Walker describes his view that DMSO has the largest potential number of uses ever documented for a single chemical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Morton Walker, DPM. DMSO: Nature’s Healer (1st ed., p. 4). Avery 1993.</p>

<p>The people have a new medical breakthrough for pain: dimethyl sulfoxide, called DMSO. By itself or in combination with other medical ingredients, dimethyl sulfoxide should be useful in treating almost every disease known to mankind. The substance, a byproduct of pulp and paper manufacturing, has been employed safely and successfully by millions of people around the world to control swelling; reduce discomfort; take away inflammation; slow the growth of, and in many instances kill, bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It heals burns and relieves sprains, strains, and arthritic joints. It has worked effectively against cataracts, sports injuries, scleroderma, myasthenia gravis, tuberculosis, and even lessened mental retardation in people with Down’s syndrome.</p>

<p>Cancer seems to respond well to DMSO. At Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, Charlotte Friend, M.D., has turned cancerous cells into harmless normal ones in the test tube by putting them in touch with the DMSO solutions. Thus, DMSO cancer research is in progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DMSO is a solvent that easily passes through skin capillaries without damage to carry other substances (but not pathogens) deeper into body tissues and organs. Once in the bloodstream, DMSO enters nearly every organ system within an hour. DMSO has powerful antioxidant properties, protects against radiation damage, and facilitates DNA repair. DMSO can help remove toxic heavy metals and other chemicals that accumulate in the body. DMSO can promote healing by increasing blood supply to area of injury, serve as an anti-inflammatory agent, and provide pain relief.</p>

<p>DMSO can be effective against some pathogens and cancers. The <a href="https://www.dmso.org/articles/information/herschler.htm" title="Pharmacology of DMSO | Stanley W. Jacob and Robert Herschler">article</a> "Pharmacology of DMSO" references studies that found DMSO at 80% concentration inactivated DNA and RNA viruses, influenza A and A-2 viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and Semliki Forest virus. For its ability to enter affected cells and carry other substances along, DMSO has been used in antiviral remedies and treatment for breast, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, and prostate cancers. DMSO can oxidize cancer cells to destroy them, and kill pleomorphic microbes that cause cancer and autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p>Dr. Stanley Jacob discovered the medicinal properties of DMSO and pioneered its medical use, which has led to more than 20,000 scientific publications. The book "Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) in Trauma and Disease" (Stanley W. Jacob, MD., Jack C. de la Torre MD, PhD. CRC Press 2015) examines the major clinical uses in humans and presents the collective data on biological, chemical, and medical actions of DMSO.</p>

<p>A 1994 <a href="https://www.dmso.org/articles/interstitialcystitis/icu.htm" title="An Interview With Dr. Stanley Jacob: Discussing DMSO | DMSO.org">interview</a> mentions, "Dr. Jacob has also been swallowing a teaspoon of DMSO every day for the past 32 years, and hasn’t had a cold or flu during that time." A 2016 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230604214104/https://www.docgriffith.com/post/2016/09/14/-father-of-dmso-passes-at-91" title="Father of DMSO Passes at 91 | Internet Archive">article</a> remarks how Dr. Jacob was able to work 6 days per week from 5AM–6PM until 90 years old. DMSO can increase blood flow in the brain, dissolve amyloids, and protect against dementia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Archie H. Scott. The DMSO Handbook for Doctors (1st ed., p. 16). iUniverse 2013.</p>

<p>As a person ages circulation usually gradually becomes impaired. This can result in a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. With a reduced amount of oxygen and nutrients brain cells can be injured or killed. DMSO can prevent this from happening. DMSO also helps the neurons in the brain to communicate with each other. All of this helps enable the person to retain mental capabilities into advanced age.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="90">Safety</h3>

<p>In the 1960s studies found that extremely high dosages of DMSO affected the eyes of some animals, but had no effect on the eyes of human and monkeys. Despite considerable evidence of human safety, in 1965 the U.S. FDA banned all clinical trials involving DMSO. Years later DMSO was approved for some limited applications.</p>

<p>At the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Scherbel had forty-four people under treatment for scleroderma. Some patients received as much as 3 g/kg per day and were treated for as long as twenty-three months. None of them showed the characteristic lens changes that were observed in the DMSO-treated animals.</p>

<p>When 11 g/kg of DMSO was applied to the skin of monkeys and 5 g/kg was given to them to drink each day for a full year, no lens changes occurred. The laboratory workers suspected that the eye changes were specific only for dogs, rabbits, and pigs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical companies continued to collect case reports in which no real toxicity of any kind was being observed. Merck and Company gradually collected 17,000 patient reports. Syntex collected approximately 7,000 and E.R. Squibb and Sons around 3,000. The FDA seemed to turn a blind eye to these human case studies, although DMSO was officially banned from human experimental use.</p>

<p>The following human study found that higher than typical DMSO dosage had no significant adverse effects, with only minor side effects from concentration and route of administration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Stanley W. Jacob, MD., Jack C. de la Torre MD, PhD. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) in Trauma and Disease (1st ed., p. 70). CRC Press 2015.</p>

<p>A short-term study (14 days) and a long-term study (90 days) were undertaken by Brobyn, who reported his findings on 213 healthy human volunteers. These volunteers were periodically examined by specialists after being administered 1 g/kg/day 80% DMSO daily. This dose was considered 3–30 times higher than the typical DMSO dose used or recommended. The specific clinical examinations included complete physical examinations with laboratory examinations of blood and urine, ophthalmologic, dermatologic, cardiologic, neurologic, pulmonary function, and bone marrow studies.</p>

<p>The results of this study concluded that no significant adverse effects from either the short-term or long-term administration of DMSO were observed after a very extensive toxicology study was conducted. Minor side effects of DMSO administered daily included skin irritation, nausea, sedation, and diarrhea, which resolved following discontinuation of DMSO. DMSO at 3–30 times the usual treatment dose in humans appeared as a relatively very safe drug, and in particular, no lens changes that were seen to occur in some animal species were detected in any subject after extensive ophthalmological examinations after 3-month follow-up. This absence of ocular changes after high and prolonged administration of DMSO has been fully confirmed in other studies. There has not been another major toxicological study on topical DMSO following Brobyn’s report, but thousands of papers dealing with DMSO and its various routes administration, including intravenous, oral, dermal, and intravesical, have reported that adverse reactions are relatively mild and usually can occur in relation to its concentration and its mode of administration.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2262105/" title="Cytotoxic effects of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) on cochlear organotypic cultures | PubMed">study</a> examined potential cytotoxic side effects of DMSO when directly applied to inner ear. In testing with rats, DMSO concentrations of 0.1% and 0.25% caused little or no damage, but concentrations of 0.5% or higher were toxic to both inner and outer hair cells important for hearing.</p>

<h3 id="91">Heart Attack and Stroke</h3>

<p>In the book "DMSO: Nature’s Healer" (Avery 1993), Dr. Morton Walker notes on page 69, "the use of massive doses of DMSO (2 gm. per kilogram body weight) in the treatment of heart attacks" and on page 262, "In the treatment of massive stroke, extremely large doses of DMSO are required for a good result. The initial dose is 2 g per kg of body weight."</p>

<p>In the book "MMS Health Recovery Guidebook" (2016) on pages 227–245, Jim Humble describes the following protocol for heart attack and stroke when medical assistance is not immediately available. The CD/MMS (<a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a>) is not mixed in the same cup with DMSO. The CD/MMS is taken within two minutes after a dose of DMSO.</p>

<div class="lined-border">
Day 1<br />
1st hour<br />
Every 15 minutes: 2 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/2 US cup water.<br />
Single dose: 6 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />
<br />
2nd hour<br />
Every 15 minutes: 1 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/4 cup water.<br />
Single dose: 6 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />
<br />
3rd hour<br />
Every 15 minutes: 1 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/4 cup water.<br />
Single dose: 3 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />
<br />
4–8th hours<br />
Every hour: 1 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/4 cup water.<br />
Every hour: 3 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />
<br />
Days 2–7<br />
Twice a day: 1 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/4 cup water.<br />
Every hour for 8 hours: 3 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.<br />
<br />
Days 8–21<br />
Once a day: 1 US tablespoon DMSO in 1/4 cup water.<br />
Every hour for 8 hours: 3 drops CD/MMS in separate 1/2 cup water.
</div>

<p>In my calculations for adults weighing 120–180 lb (54.5–81.7 kg), the 1st hour total DMSO dosage is approximately 1.6–2.4 g/kg, near the 2 g/kg initial dose that Dr. Walker notes in his book.</p>

<p>8.0 US tablespoon DMSO = 118.3 ml, × density 1.10 g/ml = 130.1 g<br />
130.1 g ÷ 54.5 kg = 2.4 g/kg<br />
130.1 g ÷ 81.7 kg = 1.6 g/kg</p>

<p>For adults weighing 120–180 lb (54.5–81.7 kg), the 1st day total DMSO dosage is approximately 4.2–6.3 g/kg. The previous section on safety mentions a study where monkeys drank 5 g/kg/day DMSO for a year.</p>

<p>21.0 US tablespoon DMSO = 310.5 ml, × density 1.10 g/ml = 341.6 g<br />
341.6 g ÷ 54.5 kg = 6.3 g/kg<br />
341.6 g ÷ 81.7 kg = 4.2 g/kg</p>

<h3 id="92">Dosage and Concentration</h3>

<p>In the book "DMSO: Nature’s Healer" (Avery 1993), Dr. Morton Walker notes on page 37, "the therapeutic dosage is far below the toxic dose" and on page 42, "The usual oral dosage of DMSO is one to two teaspoons per day."</p>

<p>In the book "Healing with DMSO" (Ulysses 2020), <a href="https://yummy.doctor/" title="Dr. Amandha Vollmer | Holistic Health Education">Dr. Amandha Vollmer</a> discusses adult oral and topical dosages of 0.25–6.0 US teaspoon/day pure DMSO (99+%), starting with a low dose. DMSO is usually diluted with purified water which allows deeper penetration when applied to skin. Concentrations: 20–50% topical for eyes (in saline), face, sensitive skin; 50% wounds, maximum for oral use; 70–80% topical for pain, muscle injury; 80% mixing with nutrients, soles of feet, tooth cavity; 99% physician use for pimple, scar tissue, small wound. Animal oral and topical use: up to 2 ml pure DMSO for every 10 lb of body weight (equivalent to 0.5 g/kg/day), diluted to 20–50% concentration.</p>

<h3 id="93">Application and Caution</h3>

<p>DMSO is a powerful solvent. Avoid contact with dyed and synthetic cloth, metal jewelry, nail polish, rubber gloves, silicone implants (proximity), tattoos, and these types of plastic: ABS, PET, polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). DMSO is non-reactive to glass, stainless steel, and these types of plastic: HDPE (2), LDPE (4), Nylon, PETE (1), PP (5), and PTFE. Store DMSO in a tightly sealed container protected from light. Warming solid DMSO above 65 °F (18 °C) will turn it liquid.</p>

<p>In her book Dr. Vollmer indicates the following:</p>

<p>Skin should be washed well with water and free of undesirable chemicals including dried soap residue, since DMSO can carry it into the bloodstream. DMSO can be applied with clean hands, undyed cotton, or natural bristle paint brush. Initially apply a small amount of 20% concentration as a patch test. Allow at least 20 minutes for DMSO to dry before contact with clothing. The effects on skin can last up to three hours so immediately wash off exposure to anything potentially toxic.</p>

<p>Brief heat and redness will occur from topical use. If too strong, applying water may reduce the effect. Repeated topical use of high concentrations can cause temporary thickening of skin, swelling, dryness, peeling, and garlic-like body odor for a few days. Staying well hydrated is important since DMSO produces a significant diuretic effect. Some may experience symptoms from detoxification or pathogenic die-off. Stop use immediately if severe allergic reaction. Avoid using DMSO during pregnancy or in combination with pharmaceutical medications for which safety has not been established.</p>

<h3 id="94">My Experience</h3>

<p>Veterinary-grade DMSO (99+% pure) liquid sold for animal use can be considerably less expensive. I purchase this in plastic bottles and transfer to glass bottles for home storage.</p>

<p>For skin care I mix drops of pure DMSO with homemade solutions to increase penetration. For oral health I occasionally use 1 US teaspoon of 50% DMSO concentration as mouthwash.</p>

<p>I mixed drops of 24% (wt/wt) potassium iodide <a href="#73" title="Another section">solution</a> with drops of pure DMSO, and repeatedly applied this to my skin where I had a small sebaceous cyst, which gradually disappeared without need for excision.</p>

<p>I briefly experienced significant pain in my hands at night (working hand syndrome) after replacing the roof on my house. I used a 50% concentration of DMSO applied topically for pain relief so that I could sleep better.</p>

<h2 id="23">Hydrogen Peroxide</h2>

<p>A brief history of hydrogen peroxide in medical use:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n18.shtml" title="Hospital Study Shows that Covid-19 Can be Prevented with Hydrogen Peroxide | Orthomolecular.org">Hospital Study Shows that Covid-19 Can be Prevented with Hydrogen Peroxide</a>. Orthomolecular Medicine News Service 2022.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is a well-known antiseptic, used extensively in dentistry and to disinfect surfaces and instruments. But many are unaware that hydrogen peroxide is a natural molecule that exists everywhere in the body, including in the immune/defensive cells that have very important biological functions to protect the body from disease.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide was discovered over 200 years ago in 1818, and in 1856 it was found to be present in the human body. In 1888, hydrogen peroxide was reported for the first time to be effective for treating numerous diseases, including scarlet fever, diphtheria, nasal catarrh, acute coryza (rhinitis), whooping cough, asthma, hay fever and tonsillitis. It was also used as an oral and nasal antiseptic in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, hydrogen peroxide was found to have a protective effect on myocardial ischemia. Intravenous infusion of hydrogen peroxide has been studied and promoted for the treatment of various diseases including cancer, skin diseases, polio and bacteria-related mental illness, even in pain relief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p id="34">In the article, Dr. Cheng describes a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9113766/" title="Further observations on hydrogen peroxide antisepsis and COVID-19 cases… | PubMed">published</a> in the Journal of Hospital Infection. Dr. Albert Amoah, Dr. Seth Ayettey, and their team reported that from April through December 2021 at two hospitals in Ghana, 4000+ inpatients and 146 healthcare workers used hydrogen peroxide 1–2 times daily. For nasal rinsing, they used 2–3 large drops per each nostril with a 0.5% concentration. For mouthwashing and gargling, they used a 1% concentration for one minute. None of the study participants developed COVID-19 infection while using hydrogen perxoide for prevention, except for one worker who had discontinued regular use. Other <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v18n19.shtml" title="HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19: AN OVERVIEW | Orthomolecular.org">studies</a> found similar results.</p>

<h3>Nebulization</h3>

<p>A compressor and nebulizer are designed to convert liquid into aerosol breathed in through a mouthpiece or mask. In his COVID-19 <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2023/01/08/safety-of-high-dose-vit-c-d-etc-in-covid-management/" title="Safety of High Dose Vit C, D etc in Covid Management | Dr. Richard Z. Cheng">protocols</a> for patients, Dr. Cheng has included nebulization of 1–3% hydrogen peroxide for 5–15 minutes, 3–4 times/day. He published the following from Dr. Thomas E. Levy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD. <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2020/11/27/hydrogen-peroxide-a-potent-anti-viral-agent/" title="Hydrogen Peroxide, a potent anti-viral agent | Dr. Thomas E. Levy">Hydrogen Peroxide, a potent anti-viral agent</a>. DrWlC.com 2020.</p>

<p>There are few molecules in the body, if any, that are singularly more important for optimal health than hydrogen peroxide (HP). It is essential for the ongoing defense against pathogens while also playing a pivotal role in the regulation of normal metabolism. HP is present throughout the body, continually generated both inside and outside of all cells (Boveris and Chance, 1973; Bao et al., 2009; Rice, 2011). HP is literally a naturally-generated antibiotic "designed by nature" to give the body its best chance at preventing an infection or at resolving an infection once contracted. It is also intimately involved in vital messaging and signaling functions between different cells as well as inside the cells themselves in order to sustain normal metabolic function. Furthermore, HP is present in the body in significant amounts, with some data indicating that as much as 5% of oxygen intake is utilized in the generation of HP (Arnaiz et al., 1999). An extremely simple molecule, HP presents no toxicity to the body except when arbitrarily administered in very high doses and concentrations, conditions that can literally make any substance toxic.</p>

<p>Regular off-the shelf 3% HP can be utilized. Preparations of greater pharmacological purity can be obtained if desired (food grade). Food grade HP typically comes in concentrations greater than 3% and must be appropriately diluted. HP in a concentration greater than 3% should never be nebulized.</p>

<p>For most adults, the 3% concentration can be utilized in the nebulization chamber undiluted. This optimizes the degree and rapidity of the antiviral and anti-pathogen effect. However, don’t be reluctant to dilute the 3% solution if not easily tolerated. Note that the first few partial inhalations might not be well-tolerated, but these initial inhalations effectively "coat" the mucous membranes with the HP mist, and subsequent inhalations are not only well-tolerated but relaxing. However, never continue inhaling any agent that makes breathing more difficult.</p>

In March 2021 I emailed Dr. Levy with a question about this and he replied, "Normal saline is fine, but I don’t think damage is being done with water dilution."</p>

<p>Dr. Levy published a free e-book <a href="https://rvr.medfoxpub.com/" title="Rapid Virus Recovery | MedFox">Rapid Virus Recovery</a> (MedFox 2021) about hydrogen peroxide and other therapies. In an April 2021 <a href="https://archive.org/details/apr-2021-dr-joseph-mercola-interviews-dr-thomas-e-levy" title="Apr 2021 Dr Thomas E Levy interview | Internet Archive">interview</a>, he mentions that swallowing pathogens may impact health of gut and patients with chronic irritable bowel syndrome have been helped by nebulization of hydrogen peroxide. He personally uses this treatment at onset of respiratory symptoms to stay healthy.</p>

<p>In a 2021 <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v17n13.shtml" title="Hydrogen Peroxide Nebulization and COVID Resolution | Orthomolecular.org">article</a>, Dr. Levy reports that nebulization longer than 15 minutes can offer additional benefit and 3% hydrogen peroxide is optimal in most cases. He describes successful use in Colombia by 20 people with viral infection, most significantly ill and some with severe respiratory difficulty. They nebulized pharmacy over-the-counter 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes, 3 times/day for the first two days and all felt much better. For the next three days, they continued nebulization with 1.5–3% hydrogen peroxide and afterward all had recovered.</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p>In 2020 I read about a variety of compressors and nebulizers, and determined that the "PARI Vios LC Plus" had a reputation for reliability, efficiency, moderate noise level, and customer support with 5 year warranty. I purchased this model (PP310F83LCPLUS) from BuyMedical.com with 30 day return policy and no prescription required. I bought extra "PARI LC Plus reusable nebulizer cup with wingtip tubing" from DirectHomeMedical.com.</p>

<p>In 2021 I took an oral dose of 2.75–5.5 g <a href="#33" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> (ascorbic acid) every 15 minutes and nebulized 3% hydrogen peroxide at onset of flu symptoms, which quickly resolved. I breathed in deeply through the mouthpiece, slowly exhaled through my nose to use my entire airway, and experienced no adverse effects.</p>

<p>Afterward I began regularly gargling, mouthwashing, and nasal rinsing with diluted hydrogen peroxide which hospital studies showed effective for prevention of viral infection. Since then I have switched to diluted <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide solution</a> which is gentler in the nose and mouth.</p>

<h2 id="21">Ionic Nanoparticle Silver (Nanosilver)</h2>

<p>In publications <a href="https://drcarolyndean.com/" title="Dr. Carolyn Dean">Dr. Carolyn Dean</a> and other physicians describe the therapeutic use of ionic nanoparticle silver for its antimicrobial properties. The treatment can be swallowed, nebulized, or applied topically depending on the type of infection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from Carolyn Dean, MD, ND. <a href="https://archive.org/details/xk7q2" title="Pico Silver: Clearing Up the Controversy | Internet Archive">Pico Silver: Clearing Up the Controversy</a>. 2018.</p>

<p>"People who take colloidal silver or silver ions are doing so to support their immune system so, it’s great news to learn that silver ions kill virus, bacteria, and fungal organisms. One research team studied silver ions and found that many types of bacteria, viruses, and fungi succumb, including the microbes that cause strep throat, pneumonia, diphtheria, gonorrhea, herpes, the flu, bronchitis, tuberculosis, and inflammatory conditions of the eyes, ears, nose, and throat."</p>

<p>"MANY USES FOR PICO SILVER<br />
1. Colds, sore throat, flus: You can take up to 1 tsp every 2 hours while awake for a total of 6 tsp. You can swish and swallow straight Pico Silver or put in 2 ounces of water and swish, gargle and swallow.<br />
2. Cough, Pneumonia: One teaspoon in a nebulizer and inhale for 10 minutes; repeat several times per day."</p>

Health Freedom News 2006;24(3):22–29.</p>

<p>In Europe, ionic silver is recognized as an accepted treatment for viral conditions. Walk into a pharmacy in Europe and tell them you’ve been diagnosed with a cold or flu — which is viral in nature — and they will look in their desk reference and find a number of silver-ion compounds or complexes listed as remedies to sell you. It seems the United States is finally catching on. A study at the University of Arizona recently showed ionic silver to be effective against the coronavirus that researchers use as the surrogate for SARS. A study out of the University of Texas reportedly suggested ionic silver may be effective against HIV-1, and researchers expect it may be shown effective against other viruses and bacteria as well. "We’re testing against other viruses and the ’super bug (Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus),’ said Miguel Jose Yacaman, from University of Texas, Department of Engineering and one of the study’s authors. “Our preliminary results indicate that silver nanoparticles can effectively attack other micro-organisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ionic nanoparticle silver should not be confused with colloidal silver, which is a different form considered outdated and far less effective due to its much larger particles. Ionic nanoparticle silver does not cause argyria, a discoloration of skin known to occur from excessive consumption of colloidal silver.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from Jim Mackay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/xk7q1" title="A Feasibility Study of Silver Dihydrogen Citrate… | Internet Archive">A Feasibility Study of Silver Dihydrogen Citrate For Use as a Nutritional Supplement</a>. 2007.</p>

<p>"Nanosilver is about 40 times more effective than colloidal silver compounds."</p>

<p>"Nanosilver has a very high therapeutic value because there is no known LD50 for nanosilver, and there is only one known deleterious side effect — argyria — and the only known side effect does not apply to nanosilver speciation, but only to colloidal silver compounds, especially silver salts. The effective dose, on the other hand, is very low when compared to a strictly theoretical lethal dose."</p>

<p>"Nano/picoscalar silver was tested against silver sulfadiazine and found to be 10-100 times more lethal against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Its efficacy was largely due to its surface area coverage, which was estimated to approach six square kilometers per cubic centimeter of product."</p>

<p>"Metal chelators (such as nanosilver) have been shown to form metal-linked dimers (two molecules linked together). By chelation (which is a process similar to the way in which silver is absorbed out of the soil by plants) to the proteins and glycoproteins, nanosilver intervenes in the virus’ life cycle, interrupting the ability of the virus to replicate."</p>

<p>"The most effective administration of the nanosilver into the body in the specific case of SARS (an URTI disease) would be to nebulize, or atomize, or vaporize, the SDC through a mechanical device, whereby the patient could breathe the nanosilver directly into the lungs. The sub-micron particles would then penetrate the viral envelope."</p>

<p>For centuries, silver (Ag) has been known to have antibacterial properties and, over the past two decades, Ag-based nanoparticles have gained traction as potential antimicrobials. The antibacterial efficacy of Ag varies with structure, size, and concentration. In the present study, we examined Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) for their antimicrobial activity and safety. We compared different commercially-available AgNPs against gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant and susceptible strains. The most effective formula of AgNPs tested had single-digit (μg/mL) minimum inhibitory concentrations against gram-negative multidrug-resistant clinical bacterial isolates with novel and emerging mechanisms of resistance. The mode of killing was assessed in E. coli and was found to be bactericidal, which is consistent with previous studies using other AgNP formulations.</p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>

<p>In spring 2020 I purchased "Silver Doc Silver Hydrosol by Research Labs 32 oz" which was competitively priced, made in a certified Utah lab, and had an established reputable history. Each 1 US teaspoon of this 0.8 nanometer (0.008 micron) 20 ppm ionic nanoparticle silver solution contains 0.1 mg of elemental silver. Plain drinking water can contain up to 0.1 mg of elemental silver per liter and be within U.S. EPA safety guidelines.</p>

<p>For symptoms of a blocked tear duct and potential eye infection, I repeatedly applied drops of ionic nanoparticle silver 20 ppm, and <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide solution</a> diluted to approximately 230 ppm. There was immediate pain relief and the condition quickly resolved.</p>

<h2 id="25">Melatonin</h2>

<p>Melatonin is found naturally in plants and animals. Production in humans occurs in the pineal gland and mitochondria of cells, and diminishes with age. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant, can increase glutathione levels, works synergistically with vitamin D, and regulates sleep-wake cycle. Supplemental melatonin has a high safety profile and can improve sleep quality, attenuate inflammation and oxidation, regulate high blood pressure and insulin resistance, and prevent mitochondrial impairment.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Z. Cheng has included 5–20 mg/night melatonin as a powerful immune booster in his COVID-19 <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2023/01/08/safety-of-high-dose-vit-c-d-etc-in-covid-management/" title="Safety of High Dose Vit C, D etc in Covid Management | Dr. Richard Z.

<p>MSM is a sulfur-based compound found naturally in plants and animals. Supplemental MSM is a water-soluble, crystalline powder made from oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide (<a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a>) naturally derived from wood. MSM is nontoxic in therapeutic dosage and can be used orally or <a href="#76" title="Another section">topically</a>. If researching MSM, it is also known as crystalline dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2), methyl sulfone, methylsulfonylmethane, organic sulfur, and sulfonylbismethane.</p>

Nutrients 2017;9(3):290.</p>
<p>"Biochemically, this manufactured MSM would have no detectable structural or safety differences from the naturally produced product [51]. Since the concentration of MSM is in the hundredths ppm in food sources, synthetically produced MSM makes it possible to ingest bioactive quantities without having to consume unrealistic amounts of food."</p>
<p>"Whether naturally produced or manufactured, MSM exhibits no biochemical differences in its ability to intermediate oxidative stress and inflammation."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="68">Benefit</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/msm-supplements" title="8 Science-Backed Benefits of MSM Supplements | Healthline">Studies</a> have found that supplemental MSM has antioxidant properties and can increase glutathione levels, benefit immune system, prevent and inhibit cancer, and improve skin health.</p>

<p>MSM is an anti-inflammatory agent that has proven effective for relief from various conditions such as allergy, arthritis, asthma, back pain, Bell’s palsy, Buerger’s disease, burn, bursitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, constipation, dental pain, fibromyalgia, headache, heartburn and hyperacidity, infection, inflammatory bowel disorder (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), interstitial cystitis, joint pain, lupus, muscle pain or spasm, rosacea, scleroderma, shingles, sinitus, tendintis, and TMJ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Stanley W. Jacob, MD., Ronald W. Lawrence, MD., Martin Zucker. The Miracle of MSM: The Natural Solution for Pain (1st ed., pp. 7–8). Berkley 1999.</p>

<p>Two of us (Jacob and Lawrence) are medical doctors with nearly ninety years of combined clinical experience treating severe and debilitating pain problems. One of us (Jacob) participated in the development of MSM and was the first physician to use MSM in the treatment of patients nearly twenty years ago. We have both repeatedly seen MSM significantly ease the suffering of patients with different types of pain and inflammatory conditions and restore their ability to function more normally. In our opinion, MSM can greatly reduce the staggering amount of disability and loss of productivity caused by chronic pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="69">Dosage</h3>

<p>In the above book, the authors suggest adult oral dosages of 2 g/day MSM for general maintenance and health, 2–8 g/day MSM for therapeutic use, and up to 40–60 g/day MSM for severe conditions supervised by a physician. Noticeable improvement may occur immediately, within days, or take months depending on condition.</p>

<p>In their clinical experience, MSM is safe for long-term daily use. Dr. Stanley Jacob personally took MSM regularly for many years. Tests have shown MSM to increase liver activity, which is not necessarily a sign of liver pathology. Patients taking a blood-thinning medication should exercise caution when taking MSM.</p>

<p>They suggest starting with a low dosage and slowly increasing as needed. Taking MSM in divided doses and with meals may help avoid gastrointestinal discomfort. Generally if the body has a greater need for MSM, there is a greater tolerance for higher dosage.</p>

<p>The following article contains similar information.</p>

<p>The reason for a slow increase is that MSM often causes some beneficial but uncomfortable cleansing reactions. This may result in headaches, nausea, diarrhea or weakness for a few days. If you are already on a high dose when this happens, just reduce or stop the intake until it is over. Cleansing reactions are a common and necessary part of effective natural healing methods.</p>

<h3 id="70">Powder Measurement</h3>

<p>Veterinary-grade MSM (100% pure) powder sold in bulk for animal use can be considerably less expensive. Recommended shelf life is two years, and tests found no loss in potency for up to five years when stored tightly sealed at cool temperature.</p>

<h2 id="22">N-acetylcysteine (NAC)</h2>

<p>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that naturally occurs in plants and can be producted by the human body from other amino acids. Taken as a dietary supplement, NAC has long been used for a wide variety of purposes. NAC efficiently increases cysteine levels for improved synthesis of glutathione, an important antioxidant that can <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v19n33.shtml" title="How to Prevent Sepsis Mortality: Part 2 | Orthomolecular.org">prevent</a> infection by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as assist in cellular health, detoxification, immune system functioning, and tissue repair. I <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1018/n-acetyl-cysteine-nac" title="N-ACETYL CYSTEINE (NAC) | WebMD">read</a> that NAC is considered likely safe for most adults.</p>

<p>In May 2020 <a href="https://www.medcram.com/pages/instructors" title="Roger Seheult, MD | MedCram">Dr. Roger Seheult</a> describes in an interesting <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/E1I4tYlCkpiU/" title="N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Benefits video | Bitchute">video</a>, "there is compelling research that NAC may also reduce the severity of viral infections like influenza, and perhaps reduce the risk of blood clots (thromboembolism) as well."

<p>To protect those who have not contracted SARS-Cov-2, oral NAC (600 mg, bid) could be an effective and economical measurement to modulate their immune systems against potential infection. Once onset symptoms appear, such as fever or dry cough, oral NAC (1200 mg, bid) could be taken to alleviate symptoms and accelerate recovery from virus infection.</p>

<p>For relatively severe patients without airway obstructions, an inhalable formula of NAC can be used with a nebulizer. Patients with allergies or asthma should take antihistamine before or during NAC inhalation, to prevent adverse reactions. Self-treatment with oral or inhalable NAC could help many SARS-Cov-2 infected patients safely recover at home.</p>

<p>Quercetin displays a broad range of antiviral properties which can interfere at multiple steps of pathogen virulence — virus entry, virus replication, protein assembly — and that these therapeutic effects can be augmented by the co-administration of vitamin C. Furthermore, due to their lack of severe side effects and low-costs, we strongly suggest the combined administration of these two compounds for both the prophylaxis and the early treatment of respiratory tract infections, especially including COVID-19 patients.</p>

Other turpentine products without that specific label (all four words) contain synthetic chemicals, some extremely toxic that damage liver.</p>

<h3 id="105">Castor Oil, Vitamin C</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil" title="Castor Oil: 4 Benefits and Uses | Healthline">Castor oil</a> was commonly used as a laxative to expel intestinal parasite die-off from natural turpentine. A typical adult oral dose is 1–2 US tablespoon of castor oil, taken on an empty stomach along with drinking liquid.</p>

<p>High-dose oral <a href="#16" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> may alleviate flu-like symptoms from toxins released by parasite die-off, and can also serve as a laxative when taken in amounts close to bowel tolerance. In the book "Curing the Incurable: Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins" (4th ed., p. 168. MedFox 2011), Dr. Thomas E. Levy remarks, "Vitamin C has demonstrated the ability to neutralize a wide variety of toxic substances, many of which are completely unrelated chemically."</p>

<h3 id="106">Kalcker Protocol P</h3>

<p>Andreas Kalcker and Miriam Carrasco Maceda developed a parasite protocol for use when conventional treatments fail. The protocol is effective for roundworms, but less so for tapeworms. The protocol is published as a 78-page chapter of Kerri Rivera’s book "Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism" (2nd ed., 2014). This is <a href="https://andreaskalcker.com/en/cds-clo2/protocolos-cds.html" title="CDS protocols | Andreas Kalcker">Protocol P</a> on Kalcker’s website and in a 14-page section of his book "Forbidden Health: Incurable Was Yesterday" (Voedia 2018).</p>

<p id="26">The protocol includes enemas to cleanse the large intestine of parasite die-off, mucus biofilm, and eggs. <a href="#20" title="Another section">Chlorine dioxide</a> (10–20 drops CD/MMS or 10–20 ml CDS) is added to 2 liters water. More can be added if tolerated. For inserting liquid, it may be convenient to use 500–1000 ml squeeze bottles with angled tip. Lay on right side and hold the liquid internally for 12–15 minutes, then sit on toilet and release liquid. Afterward drink sufficient liquid and consume electrolytes.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>A small, dormant primary tumor often remains harmless when untreated.</p>

<h3>Surgery</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/Diseases/Cancer/Cancer-Surgery-%26-Mortalilty.html" title="Cancer Surgery and Mortality | Walter Last">Dr. Ernst H. Krokowski</a> found in research that cancer surgery on a dormant primary tumor is the main cause of metastases — new growth of secondary tumors in other parts of the body. Medical procedures such as needle biopsy can disrupt a dormant primary tumor, increasing the spread of cancer cells.</p>

<p>In a 14-year <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/2/2/305/pdf" title="Surgery Triggers Outgrowth of Latent Distant Disease in Breast Cancer: An Inconvenient Truth? | MDPI">study</a> published in 2010, several physicians determined that "surgery to remove the primary tumor often terminates dormancy resulting in accelerated relapses." They suggest a new treatment to stabilize and preserve dormancy, rather than the present strategy of attempting to kill all cancer cells.</p>

<h3>Chemotherapy</h3>

<p>In a 2022 <a href="http://www.drwlc.com/blog/2022/03/06/studies-of-the-past-20-years-show-cancer-chemo-drugs-do-not-offer-significant-benefits/" title="Studies of the Past ~20 Years Show: Cancer Chemo Drugs Do Not Offer Significant Benefits | Dr. Richard Cheng">article</a>, Dr. Richard Cheng discusses several large-scale epidemiology studies of the past 20 years that have shown chemotherapy does not offer significant benefit for cancer patients. He asks, how did toxic cancer drugs become the standard therapy, given the clear lack of evidence? They are by far the most lucrative class of drugs. In 2021 chemotherapy generated 176 billion U.S. dollars in global <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18311/sales-revenues-of-drug-classes/" title="The Drugs That Bring in the Most Pharma Revenue | Statista">revenue</a> for the pharmaceutical industry, and is expected to almost double that by 2026.</p>

<p><a href="#97" title="Another section">Day</a> | <a href="#98" title="Another section">Night</a> | <a href="#99" title="Another section">For Specific Types</a> | <a href="#100" title="Another section">Injectable</a></p>

<p>As of 2024, the following is what I personally would do if diagnosed with cancer. All content is provided for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.</p>

<h3 id="97">Cancer Protocol: Day</h3>

<p>I would do alternate-day zero-calorie  <a href="#82" title="Another section">fasting</a>, which studies found can inhibit cancer. On fasting days I would continue to drink water, consume electrolytes for exercise, and take other treatments as described in this protocol.</p>

<p>On alternate days I would eat a variety of <a href="#4" title="Another section">whole plant foods</a>, which studies found can inhibit cancer. I would consume a majority of calories early in the day, which <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obr.13537" title="Distribution of energy intake across the day and weight loss… | Wiley">studies</a> found can improve metabolic health. I would emphasize raw fruits and vegetables, liquified in a large powerful blender (e.g. Vitamix). I would eat freshly ground <a href="#7" title="Another section">flaxseed</a>. I would consume natural sources high in <a href="#101" title="Another section">amygdalin</a>. I would avoid <a href="#83" title="Another section">animal proteins</a>, which can increase IGF-1 and TMAO levels to accelerate cancer growth.</p>

<p>By far the most important treatment, throughout each day I would follow the chlorine dioxide (CD/MMS) <a href="#64" title="Another section">protocol</a> described in another section, rapidly increasing to the maximum dosage tolerable. I would avoid coffee and tea, which can interfere with the benefits of chlorine dioxide.</p>

<p>I would take up to 1 g/kg/day pure <a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a>, which is 3.3–5.0 US tablespoon for a 120–180 lb (54.5–81.7 kg) adult. I would dilute this with water in another glass bottle separate from chlorine dioxide, and consume both at the same time throughout each day. This dosage may cause a garlic odor from the body and decrease over time with regular use.</p>

<h3 id="98">Cancer Protocol: Night</h3>

<p>I would take sodium bicarbonate and antioxidant supplements at night, so as not to interfere with chlorine dioxide during the day. Sodium bicarbonate is best taken on an empty stomach, since with meals it can disrupt the natural pH balance of the stomach and interfere with absorption of nutrients.</p>

<h4>Sodium Bicarbonate</h3>

<p>If healthy blood pressure and kidney function, each night I would drink sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) dissolved in water, taken in divided doses on an empty stomach. I would gradually increase the daily dosage as tolerated, and test urine pH upon waking in the morning. I would reduce dosage if urine pH is above 8.0 or experience symptoms of metabolic alkalosis such as nausea, headache, lightheadedness, confusion, muscle twitching, hand tremor, numbness or tingling in face, hands, or feet. I would supplement with <a href="#66" title="Another section">vitamin B complex</a> to avoid depletion by regular use of sodium bicarbonate.</p>

<p>In the following study, healthy volunteers consumed a daily average of 0.17 ± 0.03 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate for 90 days, taken 2–3 times per day on an empty stomach. Monitoring included urine pH, vital signs, and basic metabolic panel. The study concluded that voluntary long-term consumption of sodium bicarbonate is feasible and safe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from IF Robey, AM Lopez, DJ Roe. <a href="https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/safety-and-tolerability-of-longterm-sodium-bicarbonate-consumption-in-cancer-care-2329-6771.1000128.pdf" title="Safety and Tolerability of Long-Term Sodium Bicarbonate… | Hilaris Publisher">Safety and Tolerability of Long-Term Sodium Bicarbonate Consumption in Cancer Care</a>. J Integr Oncol 2015;4(1):1000128.</p>

<p>Invasive cancer develops from solid tumors cycling through multiple stages of somatic evolution. Heritable changes are driven by the hostile microenvironment [1]. Low extracellular pH or acidity (pH 6.5-6.7) is a major hallmark of the hostile tumor microenvironment, and a driver of metastatic potential in solid tumors such as breast and prostate [2-4]. Several studies in mouse models for cancer have demonstrated that tumor acidity can be raised or buffered to physiological pH (7.2) through oral administration of a buffering agent [5-7]. The effect of systemic buffering has been shown to reduce tumor aggression in these animal models, by preventing the spread of metastases [7,8], improving disease-free survival [7,8], inhibiting pH-sensitive invasion enzymes [7,9,10], reducing the number of circulating tumor cells [9], and reducing tumor macroautophagy [11]. In most of these animal studies the buffer treatment was sodium bicarbonate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By my calculations, the average daily dosage of 0.17 g/kg/day is equivalent to packed leveled 1.4–2.1 US teaspoon (9.3–13.9 g) of sodium bicarbonate for a 120–180 lb (54.5–81.7 kg) adult. I prefer to measure weight with the powder packed into the spoon and leveled off, since a lightly scooped spoonful is not always consistent. Using my Weighmax CT20 milligram scale and a high-quality measuring spoon, packed leveled 1 US teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate weighed approximately 6.5 g.</p>

<p>0.17 g/kg/day × 54.5 kg = 9.3 g/day, ÷ 6.5 g/US teaspoon = 1.4 US teaspoon/day</p>

<p>0.17 g/kg/day × 81.7 kg = 13.9 g/day, ÷ 6.5 g/US teaspoon = 2.1  US teaspoon/day</p>

<h4>Supplements</h3>

<p>If healthy kidney function, each night I would take the <a href="#10" title="Another section">vitamins and minerals</a> listed in another section. I would also include the following adult oral dosages, taken in divided doses at night.</p>

<ul> Most important:
    <li><a href="https://nootriment.com/alpha-lipoic-acid-dosage/" title="Alpha Lipoic Acid Dosage Guidelines & Dangers of Using Too Much| Nootriment.com">alpha-lipoic acid</a> (ALA) 1800 mg/day (e.g. bulksupplements.com).</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from Steve Hickey, PhD., Hilary Roberts, PhD. The Cancer Breakthrough: A Nutritional Approach for Doctors and Patients (1st ed., p. 69).  Lulu 2007.</p>

<p>In combination, high concentrations of vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid are more than five times as powerful as vitamin C alone. When combined, they cause greater cancer cell death than if taken separately. This feature is described as synergy: the combination is greater than the sum of the individual effects. Importantly, combination does not seem to increase toxicity.</p>

<ul>Additional if budget permits:

    <li>LivOn Labs <a href="#49" title="Another section">liposomal</a> vitamin C</li>

    <li><a href="#25" title="Another section">melatonin</a> 5–20 mg/day</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="99">Cancer Protocol: For Specific Types</h3>

<p>For cancer in a particular area (e.g. breast), I would frequently apply the following to the affected area. DMSO easily passes through skin capillaries without damage to carry other substances (but not pathogens) deeper into body tissues. I would use undyed cotton gauze as a patch to soak the skin. I would allow two hours between the two different options and never combine. I would rinse skin with water and dry before applying a different option. I would be gentle since pressure on a tumor can increase risk of metastases.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a> and <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a> (diluted CD/MMS or CDS)</li>
    <li><a href="#88" title="Another section">DMSO</a>, <a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a>, and <a href="#30" title="Another section">15% vitamin C solution</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For cancer of large intestine or prostate, I would do an <a href="#26" title="Another section">enema</a> one or more times per day with <a href="#20" title="Another section">chlorine dioxide</a> (diluted CD/MMS or CDS) and purified water. I would never use DMSO in enemas.</p>

<p>For lung cancer, I would frequently nebulize the following. I would allow two hours between the two different options and never combine.</p>

<ul>
    <li>3% <a href="#23" title="Another section">hydrogen peroxide</a></li>
    <li>12–24 mg <a href="#12" title="Another section">iodine</a> added to 0.5–1.0 US teaspoon of sterile purified water</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="100">Cancer Protocol: Injectable</h3>

<p>For any type of cancer, I would take high-dose intravenous (IV) <a href="#43" title="Another section">vitamin C</a> three days per week under medical supervision. <a href="http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/2000/articles/2000-v15n04-p201.shtml" title="Clinical and Experimental Experiences with Intravenous Vitamin C | Orthomolecular.org">Dosage</a>: 60 g/hr sodium ascorbate for two hours. Dr. Robert F. Cathcart III describes in a <a href="http://www.doctoryourself.com/vitciv.html" title="Preparation of Sodium Ascorbate for IV and IM Use | Doctor Yourself">publication</a> how he prepared this. I would include in the IV if available: alpha-lipoic acid, DMSO, selenium, and vitamin K3. I would include injectable Laetrile if available from a high-quality source (see next section).</p>

<p>I would suspend use of chlorine dioxide, from four hours before the treatment through the remainder of the day. High levels of antioxidants such as vitamin C will neutralize chlorine dioxide.</p>

<p>Four hours before the treatment, during the treatment, and through the remainder of the day, I would frequently consume oral doses of alpha-lipoic acid, selenium, and diluted DMSO to increase effectiveness.</p>

<p>Beginning 30–60 minutes after the treatment, I would consume high-dose oral vitamin C as ascorbic acid (and LivOn Labs liposomal vitamin C if budget permits) frequently through the remainder of the day.</p>

<h2 id="101">Amygdalin</h2>

<p>Physicians and researchers have shown that the plant compound amygdalin can be safely used to inhibit cancer, provide pain relief, and improve overall health.</p>

<h3>Natural Sources</h3>

<p>Grasses grown from <a href="https://hippocratesinst.org/about-us/the-diet/wheatgrass-juice-benefits/" title="Wheatgrass Juice Benefits | Hippocrates Institute">wheat</a> and barley are rich sources of chlorophyll, contain up to 100 times more amygdalin than the berry/seed, and have no gluten. These can be grown at home and repeatedly trimmed, with the cut grass stored in the refridgerator for up to a week. The grass can be juiced using a special press designed to minimize oxidation. The grass can be finely chopped and then liquified with water in a blender, briefly at low speed. Once prepared, I drink it immediately since it is not stable and quickly degrades.</p>

<p>In a 2010 <a href="http://apricot-kernels.blogspot.com/2010/11/apricot-kernels-which-should-be-used.html" title="Apricot Kernels - Which Should Be Used? | apricot-kernels.blogspot.com">article</a> Alex Tessier discusses how bitter apricot kernels/seeds can be exceptionally high in amygdalin. It depends on the type of apricot, the age of the kernels, and how they are processed after harvesting. Cooking the kernels or soaking them in water will substantially reduce the level of amygdalin. The kernels are <a href="http://apricot-kernels.blogspot.com/2010/12/apricot-kernels-myths-and-misconceptions.html" title="Apricot Kernels - Myths and Misconceptions | apricot-kernels.blogspot.com">protected</a> from pesticides by a thick shell and the outer fruit. The kernels should be purchased as fresh as possible, ideally from a reputable domestic source. The shelf life can be extended by storing the kernels in the refridgerator or freezer. He <a href="http://apricot-kernels.blogspot.com/2010/11/apricot-kernels-safe-dosage-practical.html" title="Apricot Kernels - Safe Dosage - A Practical Guide | apricot-kernels.blogspot.com">suggests</a> to start with a small quantity and chew the kernels mixed with saliva. The bitter flavor is hydrocyanic acid, which the body has several mechanisms to effectively detoxify and make useful. Generally the more bitter a kernel tastes, the higher the amygdalin content. Tolerance may increase when eaten daily.</p>

<p>A 2024 email from the Richardson family (RNCstore.com) notes that they have sold bitter apricot kernels/seeds for 50+ years and never has a customer reported injury from eating too many at once, though some people do experience nausea. <a href="https://rumble.com/v4hvrao-john-richardson-apricots-and-healing.html" title="John Richardson: Apricots and Healing video | Rumble">John A. Richardson Jr.</a> has eaten the seeds since age 5 in 1969 and currently eats 40 seeds/day in good health. The seeds that I purchased from their store are like small almonds with a black cherry flavor. I regularly eat 10 seeds/day.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>Laetrile is a refined, concentrated form of natural amygdalin first developed by research biochemist Ernst T. Krebs Jr. in 1952. He also referred to this as vitamin B17.</p>

<p>Laetrile was shown to inhibit cancer and increase longevity in animal <a href="https://www.b17.com.au/see-how-they-lie-a-closer-look-at-the-2-major-anti-laetrile-studies/" title="Laetrile Vitamin B17 | b17.com.au">studies</a> at Scind Laboratories (San Francisco CA 1968), Pasteur Institute (Paris France 1971), Institute von Ardenne (Dresden Germany 1973), and Southern Research Institute (Birmingham AL 1973).</p>

<p>Professor Harold W. Manner was chairman of the biology department at Loyola University Chicago 1972–1978 with over 30 years of research experience. He found that a combined treatment of Laetrile, emulsified vitamin A, and enzymes when injected into mice can inhibit cancer. In one study, all tumors in 84 mice regressed (75 complete regression, 9 partial regression) in eight weeks of treatment, whereas tumors continued to grow in the control group of 21 mice given only saline. In a 4-week study to test for toxicity, mice were given a daily Laetrile injection 10 times the maximum dose ever given at any human cancer clinic, and the mice became healthier than the control group not given Laetrile.</p>

<p>A senior researcher at a major cancer research organization also found Laetrile beneficial for animals with cancer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from G. Edward Griffin. World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17 (3rd ed., pp. 34–35). Dauphin 2011.</p>

<p>"For five years, between 1972 and 1977, Laetrile was meticulously tested at Sloan-Kettering under the direction of Dr. Kanematsu Sugiura. As the senior laboratory researcher there, with over 60 years of experience, Dr. Sugiura had earned the highest respect for his knowledge and integrity."</p>

<p>"Sugiura broke his experiments down into a series of tests using different types of laboratory animals and different tumors: some transplanted and some naturally occurring. At the conclusion of his experiment, he reported five results: (1) Laetrile stopped metastasis (the spreading of cancer) in mice, (2) it improved their general health, (3) it inhibited the growth of small tumors, (4) it provided relief from pain, and (5) it acted as a cancer prevention. The official report stated: The results clearly show that Amygdalin significantly inhibits the appearance of lung metastasis in mice bearing spontaneous mammary tumors and increases significantly the inhibition of the growth of the primary tumors."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ralph Moss, who was Assistant Director of Public Affairs at Sloan-Kettering, and Kanematsu Sugiura both adamantly supported Laetrile research. As a result, they were fired by their employer.

Afterward Ralph Moss wrote <a href="https://www.themossreport.com/books-by-ralph-w-moss-phd/" title="Books by Ralph W. Moss, PhD | The Moss Report">books</a> critical of how Laetrile was suppressed by powerful financial interests that favored conventional oncology (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) with high revenue and research funding.</p>

<h3>Physician Use</h3>

<p>Since the 1960s, various physicians had outstanding success using Laetrile in a combined nutritional therapy for cancer. From treating thousands of patients, Dr. John A. Richardson and Dr. Philip E. Binzel Jr. found the average long-term survival rate was around 85% for patients with primary cancer (in one place in the body), provided the vital organs had not been too badly damaged by conventional oncology. The therapy also improved quality of life and increased the survival rate for patients with metastatic cancer.</p>

<p>Physicians using this therapy were harassed by the U.S. medical establishment and authorities. Some faced expensive legal battles and imprisonment. In 1980 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to uphold a federal ban on Laetrile for medical use.</p>

<p>In 2024 treatment with injectable Laetrile is <a href="https://cancerdoctor.com/global-search/?Query_Keyword=Laetrile" title="search: Laetrile | Cancer Doctor">available</a> at <a href="https://alivenhealthy.com/posts/vitamin-b17-laetrile-amygdalin" title="The Vitamin B17 – Laetrile – Amygdalin… by Jennifer Shipp | AliveNHealthy">locations</a> in North America, Germany, and parts of Asia. Injectable Laetrile can be given intramuscular (IM), direct IV (IV push) for 1–2 minutes, or standard drip IV (diluted in saline) for 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Dr. John A. Richardson</h3>

<p>Dr. John A. Richardson used Laetrile in a combined nutritional therapy with high efficacy and safety to treat over 6000 cancer patients. His book details many case histories with meticulous medical documentation, and the obstacles he overcame. The therapy reflects the philosophy of Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, who taught "First do no harm."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excerpts from John A. Richardson, MD., Patricia Griffin, RN. <a href="https://archive.org/details/laetrilecasehist00mdjo_0" title="Laetrile Case Histories | Internet Archive">Laetrile Case Histories: The Richardson Cancer Clinic Experience</a> (pp. 24–25). Bantam 1977.</p>

<p>"Amygdalin has been well-known and listed in the United States Pharmacopeia as a non-toxic substance for over a hundred years. The human case studies submitted by McNaughton were further proof of its safety. To deny permission to test on the grounds that amygdalin may be toxic is mind-boggling when one realizes that virtually all drugs currently approved by the FDA for cancer therapy are extremely toxic."</p>

<p>"As mentioned previously, no one with real knowledge of the subject claims that amygdalin is toxic. Yet, apparently more to frighten the public away from Laetrile than anything else, spokesmen for orthodox medicine never tire of hinting at the possibility that people will be poisoned if they eat foods rich in vitamin B17."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His cancer protocol (pp. 111–113) includes a diet of whole plant foods (no animal proteins), nutritional supplements, pancreatic enzymes, and Laetrile. The protocol described in a newer edition of the book is availabe free from the Richardson family (RNCstore.com) upon request.</p>

<p>Dr. Richardson suggested the following. If desired, both oral Laetrile (capsule/tablet) and bitter apricot seeds can be used, but they should be taken separately by at least 3 hours. People new to these should begin with a small amount and gradually increase as tolerated.</p>

<ul>
    <li>people in good health, with no history of cancer: 100–200 mg/day oral Laetrile, or 5–10 seeds/day</li>
    <li>patients undergoing cancer treatment and one year afterward, on days not receiving injectable Laetrile: 500–2000 mg/day oral Laetrile (typically 1000 mg/day), or 40 seeds/day</li>
    <li>patients recovered from cancer, for rest of life: 500 mg/day oral Laetrile, or 20 seeds/day</li>

<p>If the patient notices a considerable difference in the way he feels when the injections are reduced to once weekly, the injections are increased to two or three times a week for three weeks. The dose is then reduced again to once weekly. This is repeated as often as necessary until the patient notices no difference with the reduced dosage.</p>

<p>The oral Laetrile is given in a dosage of 1 gram (two 500 rag. tablets) daily on the days on which the patients do not receive the intravenous Laetrile. I have them take both tablets at the same time at bedtime on an empty stomach with water. The water is important because there are some enzymes in the fruits and vegetables and in their juices which will destroy part of the potency of the Laetrile tablets while they are in the stomach. Once the stomach has emptied, this is no problem.</p>

<h3>Laetrile Quality</h3>

<p>Laetrile (with a capital "L") is a refined, concentrated form of natural amygdalin first developed by Ernst T. Krebs Jr. in a patented process. Laetrile turns polarized light in a left-handed direction, and is the form successfully used by the physicians and researchers mentioned above.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers produce iso-amygdalin, an artificial form that may be mislabeled as amygdalin or laetrile (with a lower case "l"). This turns polarized light in both left-handed and right-handed directions, is much less effective against cancer, and can cause adverse reactions in patients.</p>

<p>"Laetrile is produced by an extraction of ground apricot kernels. Most Laetrile produced in Mexico is obtained from the fruit kernels imported from California. The extraction process involves defatting the ground kernels, using ether or alcohol as solvents. It is estimated that 33 kernels are needed for each 500-mg tablet and 200 kernels for 3 g of the injectable form."</p>

<p>"Today, there are manufacturers who mislabel their iso-amygdalin products as amygdalin. It is important to consider that even carefully extracted amygdalin is extremely unstable when placed in solution for storage or shipment. The slightest variances in temperature or pH will cause many of the molecules to change to the same unnatural configuration obtained by poor extraction procedure with the same reduction in therapeutic efficacy. Amygdalin in solution of indefinite age is also of unpredictable quality and should be avoided. According to Dr. Krebs, Jr., all injectable Laetrile amygdalin must be lyophilized (freeze dried). Anything other than freeze dried is not Laetrile amygdalin. It is wise to primarily utilize the apricot kernels as a source of amygdalin, particularly, if there is uncertainty about the quality of the extracted amygdalin product."</p>
